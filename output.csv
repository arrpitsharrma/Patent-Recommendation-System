Methods for targeting solid tumor stem cells in a solid tumor using a notch4 receptor antagonist,US7850961B2,"Abstract
A small percentage of cells within an established solid tumor have the properties of stem cells. These solid tumor stem cells give rise both to more tumor stem cells and to the majority of cells in the tumor that have lost the capacity for extensive proliferation and the ability to give rise to new tumors. Thus, solid tumor heterogeneity reflects the presence of tumor cell progeny arising from a solid tumor stem cell. We have developed a xenograft model in which we have been able to establish tumors from primary tumors via injection of tumors in the mammary gland of severely immunodeficient mice. These xenograft assay have allowed us to do biological and molecular assays to characterize clonogenic solid tumor stem cells. We have also developed evidence that strongly implicates the Notch pathway, especially Notch 4, as playing a central pathway in carcinogenesis.","Classifications

Application of light at plural treatment sites within a tumor to increase the efficacy of light therapy,US6416531B2,"Abstract
Light is administered during photodynamic therapy (PDT) for an extended period of time at a plurality of sites distributed within the abnormal tissue of a tumor. A clinical study has shown that a substantially greater volume of abnormal tissue in a tumor is destroyed by the extended administration of light therapy from a plurality of probes than would have been expected based upon the teaching of the prior art. In this process, a plurality of light emitting optical fibers or probes are deployed in a spaced-apart array. After a photoreactive agent is absorbed by the abnormal tissue, the light therapy is administered for at least three hours. The greater volume of necrosis in the tumor is achieved due to one or more concomitant effects, including: the inflammation of damaged abnormal tissue and resultant immunological response of the patient's body; the diffusion and circulation of activated photoreactive agent outside the expected fluence zone, which is believed to destroy the abnormal tissue; a retrograde thrombosis or vascular occlusion outside of the expected fluence zone; and, the collapse of the vascular system that provides oxygenated blood to portions of the tumor outside the expected fluence zone. In addition, is possible that molecular oxygen diffusing and circulating into the expected fluence zone is converted to singlet oxygen during the extended light therapy, causing a gradient of hypoxia and anoxia that destroys the abnormal tissue outside the expected fluence zone.","Classifications

Video tumor fighting system,US4869247A,"Abstract
A destructive heat lesion is placed in any location in the brain. A patient's head is secured within a stereotactic frame. After a high resolution CT scan and angiogram or MRI, data is incorporated and analyzed by a computer. This information is then resynthesized and projected as a video image on a screen facing the surgeon. A small magnetic object, perhaps a ball, is inserted into the patient's head via a burr hole drilled through the patient's skull. Using, real time fluoroscopic data superimposed on the computer image of three-dimensional structures, the surgeon is able to control and manipulate the object through the patient's soft brain tissue to a position next to or inside of the tumor area. An energy beam is then fired at the object, causing the more heat efficient object to destroy the brain tumor area. This procedure is repeated until the entire tumor is eradicated by the highly localized hyperthermia. The above procedure can be used to deliver hyperthermia, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other agents or treatments to the brain and other parts of the body as well.","Classifications

"Method for determining if a tissue is a malignant tumor tissue, a benign tumor tissue, or a normal or benign tissue using Raman spectroscopy",US5261410A,"Abstract
A method for determining if a tissue is a malignant tumor tissue, a benign tumor tissue, or a normal or benign tissue. The present method is based on the discovery that, when irradiated with a beam of infrared, monochromatic light, malignant tumor tissue, benign tumor tissue, and normal or benign tissue produce distinguishable Raman spectra. For human breast tissue, some salient differences in the respective Raman spectra are the presence of four Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1078, 1300, 1445, and 1651 cm-1 for normal or benign tissue, the presence of three Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1240, 1445, and 1659 cm-1 for benign tumor tissue, and the presence of two Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1445 and 1651 cm-1 for malignant tumor tissue. In addition, it was discovered that for human breast tissue the ratio of intensities of the Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1445 and 1659 cm-1 is about 1.25 for normal or benign tissue, about 0.93 for benign tumor tissue, and about 0.87 for malignant tumor tissue.","Classifications

The major problem with current direct delivery techniques of therapeutic reagents into solid tumors, especially of cells or large volumes of recombinant DNA reagents or drugs, has been resistance of the tissues to the influx of the fluid and/or cells, resulting in low quantities of the fluid and/or cells penetrating into and remaining in the tumor tissue to be treated. Increased penetration and/or reduced backflow and diversion through the point of entry, so that more material is introduced into and remains in the tumor, is obtained through the use of a viscous vehicle, most preferably having a similar density to tissue, for the material to be delivered. Preferred materials include solutions or suspensions of a polymeric material which gel or solidify at the time of or shortly after injection or implantation.

Diagnostic apparatus for intrinsic fluorescence of malignant tumor,US4957114A,"Abstract
This invention relates to a diagnostic apparatus and particularly to an apparatus for the diagnosis of malignant tumor and the method of using the apparatus for diagnosis. The apparatus employs an ultraviolet light source with an emitting waveband of 3000A-4000A. Light from the light source is transmitted through a bundle of quartz optic fibers to the surface of the tumor, whether benign or malignant, to stimulate it, which then generates a specific intrinsic fluorescence spectrum. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum reflected from the surface of the tumor is transmitted by a second bundles of glass fibers placed near it to a color resolution means, then processed by a scanning means and a circuit means, and displayed recorded by a display recording means. The display may be a graphic presentation of the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the tumor that is tested. If the graphic presentation displayed includes a single peak within the range of the blue color band, it indicates that the tumor being tested is benign. If however, a second peak appears within the range of the red color band of the graphic presentation it is a characteristic peak of malignancy, indicating the existence of a malignant tumor. The presence of the red color can be established by eye rather than a complex color resolution system.","Classifications

Tumor volume determination,US4856528A,"Abstract
A computer-implemented arrangement (apparatus and method) for semi-automatically determining from CT image data the volume of a tumor. A primary application is to determining a tumor volume for patients with hepatoma and primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. CT image data of a scanned organ, stored on a magnetic tape, is read into a computer. This data includes for each of plural slices of predetermined thickness a plurality of pixels defining the slice and a CT number representing tissue density corresponding to each pixel. An image of the first slice is displayed on a monitor. A region of interest (ROI) approximating an outline of the organ is automatically generated, which outline is visually modified, if necessary, by an operator to closely correspond to the organ's outline. The particular pixels within the organ's outline and the CT numbers associated therewith are stored as a local histogram of the slice, the local histogram including data indicative of the number of pixels within the organ's outline having each unique CT number. Local histograms, produced in a similar manner for each slice, are summed to generate a global histogram indicative of the number of pixels within the organ outline's of respective slices having each unique CT number. From the global histogram, a demarcation CT number distinguishing tumor tissue from normal organ tissue is determined. From the global histogram and demarcation CT number, the organ volume and tumor volume are determined.","Classifications

Tumor targeting with polymeric molecules having extended conformation,US5762909A,"Abstract
Enhanced drug delivery to tumor tissue is obtained by attaching drug molecules to elongated polypeptide carrier molecules several orders of magnitude longer than wide. These are chosen to have a high net negative charge. The carrier molecules are created by unfolding long polypeptides by a large degree of substitution with steric hindrance molecules, such as diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) with at least 90% substitution. This causes the conformation to be worm-like as evidenced by a measure of persistence length, with a diameter small enough squeeze through the pore structures of tumor tissue but not so small as to pass through pores of vessels in normal tissue. The length is determined by optimizing two processes, blood circulation lifetime, and tumor uptake. The elongated conformation may cause the complex to become entwined with stroma in tumor interstitium and become trapped. The complex molecules provides increased therapeutic benefit in effecting tumor tissue destruction, or may be used in enhancing imaging contrast depending upon the active agent attached to the carrier molecules. The enhanced concentration and retention of the complex molecules within the tumor reduces side effects of the active agent in other tissues.","Classifications

Glycosaminoglycan derivatives and their use as inhibitors of tumor invasiveness of metastatic profusion-II,US5262403A,"Abstract
The present invention comprises a method for impeding the formation of tumor metastasis or tumor invasiveness in a host. Such inhibition comprises administration to the host of a glycosaminoglycan derivative substantially devoid of anticoagulation activity and is an effective inhibitory of heparanase activity. Such a glycosaminoglycan derivative may be provided by purchase or synthesis as directed herein. Parenteral administration to a tumor-bearing host of the glycosaminoglycan derivative results in the exposure of host-borne tumor cells thereto. Such exposure to effective levels of the derivative results in the inhibition of tumor heparanase activity and a lessening of invasiveness and metastatic spread.
Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan particularly effective as a heparanase inhibitor and an anti-clotting agent, is a preferred glycosaminoglycan for derivatization. Upon derivatization according to the present invention heparin may be converted into a glycosaminglycan derivative substantially devoid of anticoagulant activity but yet being an effective inhibitor of heparanase activity. Mere reduction of heparin carboxyl groups results in the production of a glycosaminoglycan derivative inhibitory to heparanase activity but without substantially anticoagulant activity non-anticoagulating, heparanase-inhibiting glycosaminoglycan derivatives may also be prepared from heparin, for example, by: at least partial N-desulfation and then N-acetylation; or N-, O-desulfation followed by N-resulfation.","Classifications

Human tumor-associated thomsen-friedenreich antigen,US5110911A,"Abstract
Human tumor associated Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen is purified from adenocarcinoma conditioned media, adenocarcinoma cell detergent extracts or plural effusion fluid by affinity chromatography using an insolubilized TF-specific monoclonal antibody, MAb 49H.8. The TF antigen is a glycoprotein characterized by a non-cryptic Gal β(1→3) GalNAc epitope, a molecular weight in excess of 1,000,000 daltons, and extractability with perchloric acid, the epitope being sensitive to alkali and periodate but resistant to acid. A heterologous sandwich immunoassay has been developed for human TF antigen using a monoclonal antibody as the catcher and labelled peanut agglutinin as the probe. Since human TF antigen is shed by tumor cells, a positive determination of the TF antigen in a patient sample indicates the presence of cancer. The test can also be used to monitor the course of conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy by monitoring the amount of TF antigen in a fluid sample from a patient being so treated. Because of the sensitivity of the assay method, cancer can be detected in very early stages by the assay method of the present invention.","Classifications

Tumor classification as indication of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma,US5871925A,"Abstract
Markers on chromosome 2 are associated with cancer predisposition, as shown by linkage analysis, in a significant fraction of families with a history of colon and other cancers. Tumors from these patients progressed through the same series of accumulated mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes found in non-familial cases, but showed no losses of heterozygosity for the linked chromosome 2 markers. DNA from the tumors (but not normal tissues) in most familial cases revealed a consistent and distinct abnormality: rearrangements in short repeated sequences throughout their genomes. This abnormality suggests that a large number of replication errors had occurred during tumor development. Methods are presented for detecting the presence of the gene which predisposes people to have colon and other tumors and for utilizing this information for diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive purposes. DNA markers useful for such methods are also described.","Classifications

The invention relates to methods and compositions for causing the selective targeting and killing of tumor cells. Through ex vivo gene therapy protocols tumor cells are engineered to express an α (1,3) galactosyl epitope. The cells are then irradiated or otherwise killed and administered to a patient. The α galactosyl epitope causes opsonization of the tumor cell enhancing uptake of the opsonized tumor cell by antigen presenting cells which results in enhanced tumor specific antigen presentation. The animal's immune system thus is stimulated to produce tumor specific cytotoxic cells and antibodies which will attack and kill tumor cells present in the animal.","Classifications

Methods for enriching breast tumor cells,US5648223A,"Abstract
The present invention relates to methods of enriching breast tumor cells from a patient's body fluids. In particular, it relates to the use of a cell-trap centrifugation tube containing a specific density gradient solution adjusted to a specific density to enrich for breast tumor cells from a cell mixture. The tube allows the desired cell population to be collected by decantation after centrifugation to minimize cell loss and maximize efficiency. In addition, the method can be further simplified by density-adjusted cell sorting which uses cell type-specific binding agents such as antibodies and lectins linked to carrier particles to impart a different density to the non-tumor or tumor cell populations allowing the breast tumor cells to be separated from the non-tumor cells in a more convenient manner. The rapid breast tumor cell enrichment method described herein has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, detection of tumor cells by molecular and immunochemical means, and purging of tumor cells from an autologous bone marrow cell preparation prior to re-infusion.","Classifications

Human monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies,US6140470A,"Abstract
Human monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies are isolated from fusion phage single-chain Fv and VH antibody libraries constructed from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of immunized cancer patients. Antibodies that bind to tumor cells of the same kind as the patient's are selected, and antibodies that also bind to a human normal cell type are removed. The remaining fusion phage antibodies are cloned and then are tested for binding to at least two normal human cell types. Antibodies that fail to bind to the normal cells are further tested for binding to a panel of tumor cells, typically including the original tumor type and several related and unrelated tumors. Human monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to the original tumor or also to some other tumors, or that bind to the original tumor and cells from the same developmental lineage, are obtained and sequenced. The selected antibodies can be used to design molecules which are potentially useful for various diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The single-chain Fv and VH libraries from cancer patients are also being used to select antibodies against other targets, such as endothelial cells, which have diagnostic and clinical applications.","Classifications

Injectable thermal balls for tumor ablation,US6423056B1,"Abstract
A method of tumor ablation using injectable thermal-sensing balls. A catheter system (115) is used to inject a slurry (134) of thermal-sensing balls (136) into a tumor (122) located in, for example, a liver (120). The catheter system (115) comprises a catheter (128) and a specialized syringe (129) consisting of a housing (130) and a plunger (132). The housing (130) includes a cylindrical chamber having the slurry (134) of thermal-sensing balls (136). The catheter (128) is inserted retrograde into the femoral artery and passed to the site of the tumor (122). The hepatic artery (124) branches into smaller vessels, one of which is a tumor artery (126) which feeds the tumor (122). The tip of the catheter (128) is placed in the tumor artery (126) guided by conventional fluoroscopy. The injected balls (136) then receive energy from an external control system (110). The system (110) comprises a control panel (114) as an operator interface for controlling the system (110) and reading data therefrom. A CPU (112) is used for control and monitor of the operation, and transmits power and signals to the injected balls (136) via a radiating antenna (118), which energy is converted into heat to increase the temperature of the tumor (122). The temperature of the balls (136) can then be read from one or more onboard temperature sensors, and displayed to the operator for accurate control of the tumor temperature.","Classifications

RUNX3 gene showing anti-tumor activity and use thereof,US7368255B2,"Abstract
The present invention relates to a RUNX3 gene showing anti-tumor activity which is essentially involved in TGF-β dependent-programmed cell death (apoptosis) and use thereof. In addition, the present invention finds that the RUNX3 gene expression is suppressed in the various gastric cancer and lung cancer cell lines. The suppression of the RUNX3 gene expression is due to hyper-methylation of CpG island located around RUNX3 exon (1). The RUNX3 gene and its gene product of the present invention can be used effectively for the development of anti-cancer agents. CpG island around RUNX3 exon (1) could also be used not only for the development of anti-cancer agents which regulate the abnormal DNA methylation and there by induce RUNX3 expression but also for the development of methods for cancer diagnosis by measuring the abnormal DNA methylation.","Classifications

Method for selection of primate tumor-associated antigens suitable as in vivo targets for antibodies,US5049373A,"Abstract
The present invention is a process for the selection of antigens which are suitable targets for in vivo antibody localization in human tumors or other altered (or diseased) tissue. The process provides a simplified and rapid technique for discovering useful in vivo targets for antibodies and is useful in cancer detection and therapy in humans or other primates, whether or not the antigens are specific to tumors. More specifically, the invention relates to a process for the selection of antigens suitable as targets for antibodies which localize in a tumor in vivo in which antibodies are first prepared distinguishable from those present in the animal in which biofiltration is to occur and that bind to antigens present in the tumor to be targeted. These antibodies are then injected into a non-tumor-bearing primate, into a tumor-bearing animal, and into a non-tumor bearing animal of the same species as the tumor-bearing animal to permit biofiltration of the antibodies. The biofiltered antibodies are next recovered from each of the non-tumor-bearing primate, the tumor-bearing animal, and the non-tumor-bearing animal and are employed to identify antigens whose antibodies are not retained in vivo in the primate and the non-tumor-bearing animal. The antibodies that are not retained in vivo by the non-tumor-bearing primate and the non-tumor bearing animal are then compared with those antibodies that are actually retained in vivo in the tumor-bearing animal to identify the antigens corresponding to those antibodies that are selectively retained in the tumor-bearing animal. In an alternative process, the tumor-bearing animal may be replaced by a perfusable surgically removed human organ bearing a tumor, and the non-tumor-bearing animal may be replaced by a surgically removed normal organ. Passage through a primate, however, remains the method of choice for selecting antigens whose antibodies are unabsorbed in vivo.","Classifications

It is important that the lipophilic group and hydrophilic group are bound to one and the same carbon atom; if they are separated from each other, no sufficient effect is obtained. Thus, the sensitizer possesses both lipophilicity and hydrophilicity. This sensitizer has a function of promoting acoustic cavitation and a function of revealing an antitumor effect and is an agent highly accumulable in tumor tissues. Thus, this sensitizer is highly selective for tumor tissues and enables the treatment of malignant tumor using ultrasound.","Classifications

Method for the treatment of tumors with β-glucuronidase activity dependent pharmaceuticals,US4337760A,"Abstract
Hyperacidified tumors having high β-glucuronidase activity can be treated with glucuronides with aglycones toxic to the tumor cells with great safety toward the rest of the body by first administering an alkalinizing agent in an amount sufficient to maintain the pH level of non-tumor tissues at approximately 7.4 during the glucuronide treatment. This will cause inactivation of β-glucuronidase activity in the rest of the body. When nitrile-containing aglycones are used sodium thiosulfate is also administered to avoid cyanide poisoning. Novel glucuronides are disclosed the aglycones of which exert a higher toxic effect in an acid environment or are water-soluble only in an alkaline environment. Such compounds have particular utility with the above process. By substituting radioisotopes into the aglycone, diagnosis and in situ radiation therapy may be accomplished. Bacterial cells having β-glucuronidase activity may also be diagnosed and treated in accordance with the present invention. A urine test is disclosed to determine the amount of free glucuronic acid in the urine which is an indication of the presence of a tumor in the body having high β-glucuronidase activity. Novel methods of synthesizing the glucuronide used in the present invention are also disclosed.","Classifications

Use of cyclopamine in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and other tumors,US7893078B2,"Abstract
This invention concerns the use of cyclopamine in vivo on basal cell carcinomas (BCC's) to achieve therapeutic effect by causing differentiation of the tumor cells and, at the same time, apoptotic death and removal of these tumor cells while preserving the normal tissue cells, including the undifferentiated cells of the normal epidermal basal layer and hair follicles. Causation of apoptosis by cyclopamine is by a non-genotoxic mechanism and thus unlike the radiation therapy and most of the currently used cancer chemotherapeutics which act by causing DNA-damage. These novel effects, previously unachieved by a cancer chemotherapeutic, make the use of cyclopamine highly desirable in cancer therapy, in the treatment of BCC's and other tumors that use the hedgehog/smoothened signal transduction pathway for proliferation and prevention of apoptosis.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for accurately directing a therapeutic radiation beam to a tumor or the like within a human body, including the implantation at the tumor of a source emitting radioactive rays traveling in a straight line therefrom, sensing this ray emission to determine a straight line path to the tumor, and directing the radiation beam toward the tumor by having the center line of the radiation beam coincide with the straight line path determined from the ray emitting source. Preferably, a radioactive isotope is implanted in the tumor as the source, and a collimating tubular channel member is selectively mounted on the radiation head of a radiation teletheraphy machine with the axis of the channel member coinciding with the center of the beam from the radiation head. One end of the channel member is open to receive rays emitted from the implanted source and the other end is associated with a device for detecting these rays. The detecting device produces an electrical signal in response to the rays sensed, this electrical signal being greater as the straight line path of emitted rays come into coincidence with the axis of the opening in the channel member, and the magnitude of the electrical signal is visually displayed. The teletherapy machine operator manipulates either the patient or the radiation head until the displayed signal indicates a maximum magnitude, removes the channel member and energizes the radiation head.","Classifications

"Methods, systems and products for predicting response of tumor cells to a therapeutic agent and treating a patient according to the predicted response",US20140127238A1,"Abstract
The invention provides methods for treating patients which methods comprise methods for predicting responses of cells, such as tumor cells, to treatment with therapeutic agents. These methods involve measuring, in a sample of the cells, levels of one or more components of a cellular network and then computing a Network Activation State (NAS) or a Network Inhibition State (NIS) for the cells using a computational model of the cellular network. The response of the cells to treatment is then predicted based on the NAS or NIS value that has been computed. The invention also comprises predictive methods for cellular responsiveness in which computation of a NAS or NIS value for the cells (e.g., tumor cells) is combined with use of a statistical classification algorithm. Biomarkers for predicting responsiveness to treatment with a therapeutic agent that targets a component within the ErbB signaling pathway are also provided.","Classifications

Individualized patient-specific anti-cancer antibodies,US6180357B1,"Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for producing patient specific anti-cancer antibodies using a novel paradigm of screening.

The invention further relates to the process by which the antibodies are made and to their methods of use. The antibodies can be made specifically for one tumor derived from a particular patient and are selected on the basis of their cancer cell cytotoxicity and simultaneous lack of toxicity for non-cancerous cells. The antibodies can be used in aid of staging and diagnosis of a cancer, and can be used to treat tumor metastases. The anti-cancer antibodies can be conjugated to red blood cells obtained from that patient and re-infused for treatment of metastases based upon the recognition that metastatic cancers are usually well vascularized and the delivery of anti-cancer antibodies by red blood cells can have the effect of concentrating the antibodies at the site of the tumor.","Classifications

Method for imbuing individuals with religious faith by combining scriptural and biographical readings,US20070132166A1,"
A method and resulting product of generating a bible torah or other religious text personalized to an intended recipient. The person giving the bible selects a characterization of a bible, such as a cowboy bible, truck driver's bible, lawyer's bible, children's bible, woman's bible and the like. Then the giver selects an age group of the intended recipient of the bible. Based on this information the system then presents a form for the giver to select from a list of problems experienced by said intended recipient. The giver is then given an opportunity to select additional passages from the bible or other sacred texts to be highlighted. A personalized message with sections highlighted which related to an intended recipients age and problems. This message can be a bound volume produced by the steps of feeding lightweight paper through a printer, printing using an inkjet technique or other relatively thinly deposited ink to print on said paper to result in producing printed paper, and binding said printed paper into a volume. The inventive combination may incorporate lightweight or ordinary paper in one volume of a scriptural or underlying religious text (such as the Holy Bible, the Torah, or the Qur'an) and a biographical text detailing the triumphs and hardships of the life of either a celebrated public figure or an extraordinary but seemingly every-day character. By cross-referencing these two texts, and packaging them in a single volume form where they can easily be flipped between, the teachings of a particular religious faith can be made more readily accessible to the public at large.","Classifications

A universal machine translator of arbitrary languages enables the semantic, or meaningful, translation of arbitrary languages with zero loss of meaning of the source language in the target language translation, which loss is typical in prior art human and machine translations. The universal machine translator embodies universal transformations itself and comprises the means for identifying high-level grammatical constructions of a source language word stream, constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the source language high-level word stream, decomposing source and target languages into universal moments of meaning, or epistemic instances, translating the epistemic moments of source and target languages with substantially no loss in meaning, constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the target language high-level word stream, optionally adjusting the target language syntax to comply with a preferred target language grammar, and generating the translated target language word stream. The universal machine translator also comprises the means to embody arbitrary sensory/motor receptions and transmissions of arbitrary word streams, which allows universally translated communications to occur among human beings and machines.","Classifications

Medical network management system and process,US5471382A,"
In a medical network management system (NMS) (20), health plan beneficiaries access a team of health care professionals over the telephone to help them assess their health needs and select appropriate care. The NMS (20) has a patient assessment component (22). The patient assessment component consists of a set of information tools which are used by health care professionals to assess patient conditions and assist in the selection of health care services and to help patients find appropriate care at the appropriate time. The tools include a comprehensive, automated set of proprietary assessment algorithms (26) which are based on branched chain algorithms utilizing Bayes theorem. These unique, clinical tools enable a trained nurse or other health care professional to sort patients into different risk categories, safely and effectively without requiring a medical diagnosis. Patients can then be guided to an appropriate level and type of care for their problem(s) based on their level of risk and set of potential needs.","Classifications

Method and computer-based system for non-probabilistic hypothesis generation and verification,US7062508B2,"
The invention provides a method, apparatus and algorithm for data processing that allows for hypothesis generation and the quantitative evaluation of its validity. The core procedure of the method is the construction of a hypothesis-parameter, acting as an “ego” of the non-biological reasoning system. A hypothesis-parameter may be generated either based on totality of general knowledge facts as a global description of data, or by a specially designed “encapsulation” technique providing for generation of hypothesis-parameters in unsupervised automated mode, after which a hypothesis-parameter is examined for concordance with a totality of parameters describing objects under analysis. The hypothesis examination (verification) is done by establishing a number of copies of a hypothesis-parameter that may adequately compensate for the rest of existing parameters so that the clustering could rely on a suggested hypothesis-parameter. The method of this invention is based on the principle of the information thyristor and represents its practical implementation.","Classifications

"Method for Teaching Individuals About the Comprehension of Religious Texts by Synchronizing Contemporaneous Print, Visual and Audio Learning Opportunities",US20170301254A1,"
A method and resulting product of generating a bible torah or other religious text personalized to an intended recipient. The person giving the bible selects a characterization of a bible, such as a cowboy bible, truck driver's bible, lawyer's bible, children's bible, woman's bible and the like. Then the giver selects an age group of the intended recipient of the bible. Based on this information the system then presents a form for the giver to select from a list of problems experienced by said intended recipient. The giver is then given an opportunity to select additional passages from the bible or other sacred texts to be highlighted. A personalized message with sections highlighted which related to an intended recipients age and problems. This message can be a bound volume produced by the steps of feeding lightweight paper through a printer, printing using an inkjet technique or other relatively thinly deposited ink to print on said paper to result in producing printed paper, and binding said printed paper into a volume. The inventive combination may incorporate lightweight or ordinary paper in one volume of a scriptural or underlying religious text (such as the Holy Bible, the Torah, or the Qur'an) and a biographical text detailing the triumphs and hardships of the life of either a celebrated public figure or an extraordinary but seemingly every-day character. By cross-referencing these two texts, and packaging them in a single volume form where they can easily be flipped between, the teachings of a particular religious faith can be made more readily accessible to the public at large.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for recommending a match to another,US7085806B1,"
The present invention comprises a method and apparatus for locating and recommending a match to another. The invention provides people with a way to take an active role in matchmaking between a friend, family member or client of theirs and a prospect date from a database of prospect-users. For example, users may be provided with the ability to review a repository of users who have registered with a dating service (referred to as prospect-users) in order to search for a person who may be compatible with a friend or associate of the user performing the search (referred to as a searching-user). If the searching-user locates a prospect-user whom the searching-user thinks may be of interest to the searching-user's friend or associate (referred to as a client-user), the searching-user may recommend that person to the prospect-user. Thus, the invention provides a way to transmit a recommendation message to the prospect-user via a communication conduit such as a computer network. After viewing an associated profile on the client-user, the prospect-user may respond to the recommendation message by sending a response message to the client-user. The client-user may then view a profile on the prospect-user and elect to reply to the prospect-user's response message. If all of the parties involved indicate a willingness to meet, the system provides a way for the parties to contact one another.","Classifications

Methods using social topical adaptive networking system,US20140236953A1,"
A machine-implemented social networking system builds up and repeatedly refreshes a hierarchy tree containing topic nodes. New nodes are added as new topics emerge in online public forums. Each topic node can link to an on-topic real time chat room whose occupants are currently discussing the topic of the node. A chat room can be pointed to by more than one node if the room is discussing multiple topics. Rooms can migrate from node to node as room topic dynamically changes. A system user who explicitly or inferentially wishes to be invited into a chat room which is on-topic with what the user is currently focused upon can do so by use of a node-seeking automated process. The process operates in the background and seeks out nodes of the hierarchy tree that currently have topics appearing to be the same as or similar to what topics the user appears to have in mind. Content browsing experience of the user is enhanced by addition of an invitations displaying subsystem that automatically invites him or her to co-compatible chat rooms currently discussing the topic(s) the user appears to have in mind. One of the many topics that a user may inferentially have in mind is that of being at a given location as reported by the user's GPS and wondering what best to do at that location and time.","Classifications

A would-be subscriber first specifies profile information including authentication information, information relating to qualities desired in a friend and mate, the relative importance of the respective categories, and a screen image icon. The profile information is stored in a database associate with a web server hosting the dating site. The subscriber can then log onto the site and advantage the of chat room environments featured at the site. Rooms are hierarchically organized into lobbies and sub-lobbies corresponding to topics and sub-topics of discussion. In addition, the lobby and sub-lobby screens indicate the concentration of compatible participants in the rooms of corresponding lobbies and sub-lobbies, thus allowing easy navigation to a desirable room. In addition to manual navigation, the site features automatic navigation allowing the user to find a chat room with compatible participants automatically once a sub-lobby is selected. Upon participating in a chat session, the user and a participant may choose a “virtual date” option featured at the site to take advantage of a private chat environment and to view a private, date-related video clip. “Physical Attractiveness” criteria also permit the subscriber to screen members in the database based on community ratings of the physical attractiveness of the members and to limit access to the subscriber's profile to members having a physical attractiveness ranking within a user-selected range around that of the physical attractiveness ranking for the subscriber.","Classifications

Following such dissemination, the encoded content is played on a playback console, such as a radio, television, or related peripheral content playback device. A device connected to or incorporated within the playback console, both extracts the encoded meta data from the encoded content and transmits the resulting decoded meta data and related information via an attached short-range wireless transceiver to a target device (e.g. a short-range wireless enabled cellular phone). Thereafter, the user's target device allows the user to view relevant portions of the relayed data package as a textual message on the display of the target device, and respond to this message by submitting a user response via the target device keypad. The target device sends a textual message response (incorporating the user response and associated data) via the target device's wireless network's short message service (or equivalent) to an entity, such as the interactive communication system operator, which may thereafter act upon the textual message response so received. A further act of the entity could involve the entity auditing, storing, and analyzing the data relating to the textual message response, forwarding data related to the textual message response to an appropriate further entity, or initiating a subsequent communication back toward the user of the short-range wireless enabled cellular phone, or any combination thereof. The content brokerage engine can also be used for the matching of content and meta data in communication systems distinct from and separate to the interactive communication system.","Classifications

Speed--the Mach Factor--accounts for up to 50% of the total values in the games. Part I of the games of the invention declares what I call Vectorial games and game-systems. This group is divided into three categories: miniature Mancala-like games, pyramidic games and tangramatic games. Part II relates to games which evidence new and improved formats, apparatus and methods for making and playing traditional Mancala type games. Several examples illustrate a variety of simulated scenarios, utility functions, methods of play and commercially feasible embodiments e.g. boards, encasements, video-cartridges, hand-held computers and the like. Finally, a new and improved notation system is disclosed. All in all, the various aspects of the invention, together with the standardization of play at professional levels, should lead to the local and international re-vitalization of interest in Vectorial and Mancala-like games.","Classifications

System and method for managing security for a distributed healthcare application,US20010051879A1,"
A system and method for managing security for a distributed healthcare system, such as a system for placing laboratory orders and receiving test results. The network of healthcare businesses that use the system is referred to herein as a Health Data Network, or HDN. When the user log on to the system, the user connects to the system on behalf of a Health Data Network (HDN) Business. Through the user's user account, the user is linked with HDN Businesses. The user may be allowed to log on to the system on behalf of more than one HDN Business. If the user's practice has more than one location or business unit, and all orders and results are shared throughout the practice, the user's practice may be configured as a single HDN Business. In this case, the practice's data may be stored in a central location and can be accessed by all users who have the appropriate permissions. However, if the user's practice has more than one location or business unit, and the need exists to keep orders and results isolated within a location or business unit, the practice may be configured in a parent-child HDN Business relationship. In addition to the ability to log on to the system on behalf of an HDN Business, users also must have permission to actually use the many functions of the system, and need access to the data stored across the HDN. As part of creating the user's permission profile, the user is assigned a role that the user performs when working with the system. This includes information regarding the types of data the user needs to be able to access and the functions the user needs to carry out on that data. Types of data are referred to as objects and functions are referred to as operations. Patient records, lab requisitions, lab results, test codes, ICD-9 codes, lab profiles and physician profiles are examples of objects. An example of an operation is adding new objects. Viewing, modifying, printing, and deleting existing objects are also examples of operations. The process of searching for existing objects is also considered an operation. A role defines what objects a user can access and what operations a user is allowed to carry out on each of those objects.","Classifications

If there are errors in the information entered for the requisition, an error message may appear, and the user may be required to correct the errors. As part of performing this validation, the system may verify insurance information for the requisition, if applicable. In one embodiment, the system interfaces with a separate eligibility server to check for valid patient insurance. For example, the eligibility server may receive the patient name, social security number, and/or other identification information and use this information to check the patient's insurance status. If the patient does not have insurance coverage for the requested lab tests to be performed, the insurance information may be corrected, or other means for payment may be required. Once the requisition information has been validated, the information may be stored. The user may later use a menu option to select and electronically send the requisitions, e.g., by interfacing a middleware server which interfaces with the system for each laboratory which receives the requisitions. In another embodiment, the patient insurance information may be verified after being sent to the middleware server. The middleware server may interface with a separate eligibility server to verify the insurance information. If the insurance information is verified then the middleware server may transmit the requisition information to one or more laboratories specified in the requisition. Otherwise, the originating caregiver may be notified, and the requisition information may not be sent to the laboratories.","Classifications

Factor analysis of information risk,US20050066195A1,"
The invention is a method of measuring and representing security risk. The method comprises selecting at least one object within an environment and quantifying the strength of controls of at least one object within that environment. This is done by quantifying authentication controls, quantifying authorization controls, and then quantifying structural integrity. In the preferred method, the next step is setting global variables for the environment, for example, whether the environment is subject to regulatory laws, and then selecting at least one threat community, for example, professional hackers, and then calculating information risk. This calculation is accomplished by performing a statistical analysis using the strengths of controls of said at least one object, the characteristics of at least one threat community, and the global variables of the environment, to compute a value representing information risk. The method identifies the salient objects within a risk environment, defines their characteristics and how they interact with one another, utilizing a means of measuring the characteristics, and a statistically sound mathematical calculation to emulate these interactions and then derives probabilities. The method then represents the security risk, such as the risk to information security, such as by an integer, a distribution or some other means.","Classifications

Explicit representation of molecular shape of molecules is combined with neural network learning methods to provide models with high predictive ability that generalize to different chemical classes where structurally diverse molecules exhibiting similar surface characteristics are treated as similar. A new machine-learning methodology that can accept multiple representations of objects and construct models that predict characteristics of those objects. An extension of this methodology can be applied in cases where the representations of the objects are determined by a set of adjustable parameters. An iterative process applies intermediate models to generate new representations of the objects by adjusting said parameters and repeatedly retrains the models to obtain better predictive models.

Computer implemented machine learning and control system,US5946673A,"
In a computer implemented learning and/or process control system, a computer model is constituted by the most currently fit entity in a population of computer program entities. The computer model defines fitness as a function of inputs and outputs. A computing unit accesses the model with a set of inputs, and determines a set of outputs for which the fitness is highest. This associates a sensory-motor (input-output) state with a fitness in a manner that might be termed ""feeling"". The learning and/or control system preferably utilizes a compiling Genetic Programming system (CGPS) in which one or more machine code entities such as functions are created which represent solutions to a problem and are directly executable by a computer. The programs are created and altered by a program in a higher level language such as ""C"" which is not directly executable, but requires translation into executable machine code through compilation, interpretation, translation, etc. The entities are initially created as an integer array that can be altered by the program as data, and are executed by the program by recasting a pointer to the array as a function type. The entities are evaluated by executing them with training data as inputs, and calculating fitnesses based on a predetermined criterion. The entities are then altered based on their fitnesses using a genetic machine learning algorithm by recasting the pointer to the array as a data (e.g. integer) type. This process is iteratively repeated until an end criterion is reached.","Classifications

Data center activity traces form a corpus used for machine learning. The data in the corpus are putatively normal but may be tainted with latent anomalies. There is a statistical likelihood that the corpus represents predominately legitimate activity, and this likelihood is exploited to allow for a targeted examination of only the data representing possible anomalous activity. The corpus is separated into clusters having members with like features. The clusters having the fewest members are identified, as these clusters represent potential anomalous activities. These clusters are evaluated to determine whether they represent actual anomalous activities. The data from the clusters representing actual anomalous activities are excluded from the corpus. As a result, the machine learning is more effective and the trained system provides better performance, since latent anomalies are not mistaken for normal activity.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for performing extraction using machine learning,US6857112B1,"
A system for using machine-learning to create a model for performing integrated circuit layout extraction is disclosed. The system of the present invention has two main phases: model creation and model application. The model creation phase comprises creating one or more extraction models using machine-learning techniques. First, a complex extraction problem is decomposed into smaller simpler extraction problems. Then, each smaller extraction problem is then analyzed to identify a set of physical parameters that fully define the smaller extraction problem. Next, models are created using machine learning techniques for all of the smaller simpler extraction problems. The machine learning is performed by first creating training data sets composed of the identified parameters from typical examples of the smaller extraction problem and the answers to those example extraction problems as solved using a highly accurate physics-based field solver. The training sets are then used to train the models. In one embodiment, neural networks are used to model the extraction problems. Bayesian inference is employed by one embodiment in order to train the neural network models. Bayesian inference may be implemented with normal Monte Carlo techniques or Hybrid Monte Carlo techniques. After the creation of a set of models for each of the smaller simpler extraction problems, the machine-learning based models may be used for extraction.","Classifications

Semi-supervised random decision forests for machine learning using mahalanobis distance to identify geodesic paths,US9519868B2,"
Semi-supervised random decision forests for machine learning are described, for example, for interactive image segmentation, medical image analysis, and many other applications. In examples, a random decision forest comprising a plurality of hierarchical data structures is trained using both unlabeled and labeled observations. In examples, a training objective is used which seeks to cluster the observations based on the labels and similarity of the observations. In an example, a transducer assigns labels to the unlabeled observations on the basis of the clusters and certainty information. In an example, an inducer forms a generic clustering function by counting examples of class labels at leaves of the trees in the forest. In an example, an active learning module identifies regions in a feature space from which the observations are drawn using the clusters and certainty information; new observations from the identified regions are used to train the random decision forest.","Classifications

Application of category theory and cognitive science to design of semantic descriptions for content data,US7319951B2,"
Instead of focusing on specific, static semantic description schemes, emphasis and focus is placed on determining what is necessary and needed to create any type or kind of semantic description for content data in various applications such as MPEG-7. In particular, numerous semantic description tools are selected after examining the principles of cognitive science and category theory. These semantic description tools provide sufficient flexibility and power to create any type or kind of semantic description. Semantic entity tools and categorical structure tools were identified as necessary and needed to create any type or kind of semantic description. Semantic entity tools are tools that represent entities in a semantic description. Categorical structure tools are tools that represent categorical structures of semantic entities and relations among these categorical structures. The semantic entity tools and the categorical structure tools facilitate creation of a semantic mosaic description for content data from multiple semantic descriptions.","Classifications

Method of partitioning data records,US7272612B2,"
A tree-structured index to multidimensional data is created using occurring patterns and clusters within the data which permit efficient search and retrieval strategies in a database of DNA profiles. A search engine utilizes hierarchical decomposition of the database by identifying clusters of similar DNA profiles and maps to parallel computer architecture, allowing scale up past previously feasible limits. Key benefits of the new method are logarithmic scale up and parallelization. These benefits are achieved by identification and utilization of occurring patterns and clusters within stored data. The patterns and clusters enable the stored data to be partitioned into subsets of roughly equal size. The method can be applied recursively, resulting in a database tree that is balanced, meaning that all paths or branches through the tree have roughly the same length. The method achieves high performance by exploiting the natural structure of the data in a manner that maintains balanced trees. Implementation of the method maps to parallel computer architectures, allowing scale up to very large databases.","Classifications

System for estimating a distribution of message content categories in source data,US9189538B2,"
A method of computerized content analysis that gives “approximately unbiased and statistically consistent estimates” of a distribution of elements of structured, unstructured, and partially structured source data among a set of categories. In one embodiment, this is done by analyzing a distribution of small set of individually-classified elements in a plurality of categories and then using the information determined from the analysis to extrapolate a distribution in a larger population set. This extrapolation is performed without constraining the distribution of the unlabeled elements to be equal to the distribution of labeled elements, nor constraining a content distribution of content of elements in the labeled set (e.g., a distribution of words used by elements in the labeled set) to be equal to a content distribution of elements in the unlabeled set. Not being constrained in these ways allows the estimation techniques described herein to provide distinct advantages over conventional aggregation techniques.","Classifications

The Universal Automatic Instant Money, Data and Gold Transfer Machine, Uncle GEM II, system is a multiplicity of devices on a communications network available 24 hours a day, used interchangeably as sender, receiver and dispenser of funds and data. The sender accepts standard currency and includes removable medium storage devices to transfer to another such device acting as a receiver/dispenser. Remitted amounts are inserted or deducted from credit/debit accounts or currency and who pays the fees charged is indicated by an initiator of the transaction. Transfer transaction information includes: the type of transfer (money/funds or data); which device deducts the fee; how much money or what data to transfer; and to who and where the transfer transaction is to be made available. A receipt is generated by the sender via the system and a receiver becomes a dispenser when the recipient retrieves a pending transaction using the appropriate password or identification. The cash, data, or financial instrument is then dispensed. The Uncle GEMs also feature acceptance of alternate payment options, such as, precious metal coins, i.e., gold, silver and platinum, and precious stones, i.e. diamonds, sapphires, and rubies. In essence, virtually anything can be bought, purchased, bartered, traded or sold. Smartcards, phonecards and store specific cards can be used to buy goods and services, can be bought, or can be reloaded using the Uncle GEM II system.","Classifications

Method for constructing segmentation-based predictive models from data that is particularly well-suited for insurance risk or profitability modeling purposes,US7072841B1,"
The invention considers a widely applicable method of constructing segmentation-based predictive models from data that permits constraints to be placed on the statistical estimation errors that can be tolerated with respect to various aspects of the models that are constructed. The present invention uses these statistical constraints in a closed-loop fashion to guide the construction of potential segments so as to produce segments that satisfy the statistical constraints whenever it is feasible to do so. The method is closed-loop in a sense that the statistical constraints are used in a manner that is analogous to an error signal in a feed-back control system, wherein the error signal is used to regulate the inputs to the process that is being controlled.","Classifications

The unique features of the SDL language are the implicit constraints that are enforced on the relational data that belong to the objects. Unique to the SDL system is also the logical metadata of dimensions that enables the SDL system to enforce these constraints across relations. The SDL system utilizes several optimization techniques to enable efficient implementation on top of RDBMS. It is also shown how the SDL language and the SQL language can be merged with bidirectional inlining using syntactic gates. Query composition tools are also described that facilitate the creation of SDL expressions.","Classifications

Method for image data processing,US7756342B2,"
A method for exploiting the nonlinear structure of hyperspectral imagery employs a manifold coordinate system that preserves geodesic distances in the high-dimensional hyperspectral data space. Data representing physical parameters such as a scene is divided into a set of smaller tiles. The manifolds derived from the individual tiles are then aligned and stitched together to complete the scene. Coordinates are derived for a very large although not complete representative subset of the data termed the “backbone”. Manifold coordinates are derived for this representative backbone and then the remaining samples inserted into the backbone using a reconstruction principle using the property of local linearity everywhere on the manifold to reconstruct the manifold coordinates for the samples not originally belonging to the backbone. The output is a global manifold coordinate system, which for topographical image data depicts clearer detail of land and water portions of a scene.","Classifications

Data structures, systems, methods and computer program products that enable precise information retrieval and extraction, and thus facilitate relational and associative discovery are disclosed. The present invention utilizes a novel data structure termed a “Knowlet” which combines multiple attributes and values for relationships between concepts. While texts contain many re-iterations of factual statements, Knowlets record relationships between two concepts only once and the attributes and values of the relationships change based on multiple instances of factual statements, increasing co-occurrence or associations. The present invention's approach results in a minimal growth of the Knowlet space as compared to the text space and it thus useful where there is a vast data store, a relevant ontology/thesaurus, and a need for knowledge navigation and (relational, associative, and/or other) knowledge discovery.","Classifications

Techniques for determining orbital data,US4912475A,"
Techniques are disclosed for determining orbital data of space borne vehicles including earth satellites such as those of the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System. Each of a set of such satellites transmits signals which include carrier waves which may be suppressed, or only implicity present. The signals are received from the observable satellites concurrently by means of an antenna at each of at least three ground stations forming a network of baselines. The stations are arrayed such that the ratio of the maximum to the minimum baseline length is much greater than one. From the signals received at a station pair forming each baseline a time series of doubly-differenced phase measurement data is formed which is biased by an integer number of cycles of phase. The data series for different satellite and station pairs are processed together to determine the orbits of the satellites and the doubly-differenced phase biases. Unique determination of the integer values of at least some of the biases is facilitated by the above noted spatial arrangement of the stations such that the ratio of the maximum to the minimum baseline length is much greater than one. This integer bias determination enhances the accuracy of the related orbit determination.
Unique determination of the integer values of at least some of the doubly-differenced carrier phase biases may also be facilitated by the use of a plurality of carrier frequencies with the ratio of the maximum to the minimum frequency being much greater than one.","Classifications

A directed graph is created which depicts the identities of the ""derived"" GAPs, the ""defining"" GAPs from which derived GAPs can be interpolated, and the relationship between them. The GAPs reside at nodes on the graph which are interconnected with directed links that indicate the ""parent"" to ""child"" relationships, with each link representing an interpolation function which defines how the derived GAPs are interpolated from the defining GAPs. The graph and interpolation functions are conveyed to a decoder. Frames containing defining GAPs are then sent to the decoder, which performs the interpolations as directed by the graph and using the interpolation functions to reconstruct the derived GAPs.","Classifications

Multiplex cellular assays using detectable cell barcodes,US8003312B2,"
We describe herein a cell-based multiplexing technique called detectable cell barcoding (DCB). In DCB, each individual sample is labeled with a different DCB signature that distinguishes each sample by one or both of detected intensity or type of detection characteristic. The samples are then combined and analyzed for a detectable characteristic of interest (e.g., presence of an analyte). By employing multiple distinct DCB labels at varying concentrations, one can perform multiplex analyses on up to hundreds or thousands (or more) of cell samples in a single reaction tube. DCB reduces reagent consumption by factors of 100-fold or more, significantly reduces data acquisition times and allows for stringent control sample analysis.","Classifications

A natural language translation method and system translating medical reports created in natural language into structured data frames that can be utilized in computer databases for decision support, billing, research, and other purposes. Structured data entry is elicited from a patient in order to identify an appropriate disease signature corresponding to his or her condition and symptoms. In turn, the disease signature identifies the appropriate lexical domain with which to analyze the natural language report. The translation method and system use statistical analysis based on empirical data that particular combinations of words have interdepended previously within a modeled context and how frequently individual words interdepend generally and with what kinds of words. For each sentence in the report, the words in the medical report are looked up in the lexical domain individually and in combination with all other words coexisting in the same sentence. The word combinations are parsed to determine the likelihood the words interdepend in the report. For those words determined to interdepend, a semantic interpreter defines the semantic relationship between the words. A frame generator compiles the word relationships into records having fields recognized as pertinent by the disease signature and that can be searched and sorted by computers on those fields.","Classifications

Enhanced block ciphers with data-dependent rotations,US6269163B1,"
A plaintext message to be encrypted is segmented into a number of words, e.g., four words stored in registers A, B, C and D, and an integer multiplication function is applied to a subset of the words, e.g., to the two words in registers B and D. The integer multiplication function may be a quadratic function of the form ƒ(x)=x(ax+b) or other suitable function such as a higher-order polynomial. The results of the integer multiplication function are rotated by lg w bits, where lg denotes log base 2 and w is the number of bits in a given word, to generate a pair of intermediate results t and u. An exclusive-or of another word, e.g., the word in register A, and one of the intermediate results, e.g., t, is rotated by an amount determined by the other intermediate result u. Similarly, an exclusive-or of the remaining word in register D and the intermediate result u is rotated by an amount determined by the other intermediate result t. An element of a secret key array is applied to each of these rotation results, and the register contents are then transposed. This process is repeated for a designated number of rounds to generate a ciphertext message. Pre-whitening and post-whitening operations may be included to ensure that the input or output does not reveal any internal information about any encryption round. Corresponding decryption operations may be used to decrypt the ciphertext message.","Classifications

Data authentication using modification detection codes based on a public one way encryption function,US4908861A,"
A cryptographic method and apparatus are disclosed which transform a message or arbitrary length into a block of fixed length (128 bits) defined modification detection code (MDC). Although there are a large number of messages which result in the same MDC, because the MDC is a many-to-one function of the input, it is required that it is practically not feasible for an opponent to find them. In analyzing the methods, a distinction is made between two types of attacks, i.e., insiders (who have access to the system) and outsiders (who do not). The first method employs four encryption steps per DEA block and provides the higher degree of security. Coupling between the different DEA operations is provided by using the input keys also as data in two of the four encryption steps. In addition, there is cross coupling by interchanging half of the internal keys. Although this second coupling operation does not add to security in this scheme, it is mandatory in the second method, which employs only two encryption steps per DEA block to trade off security for performance. By providing key cross coupling in both schemes, an identical kernel is established for both methods. This has an implementation advantage since the first method can be achieved by applying the second method twice. The MDC, when loaded into a secure device, authorizes one and only one data set to be authenticated by the MDC, whereas methods based on message authentication codes or digital signatures involving a public key algorithm authorize a plurality of data sets to be authenticated. The MDC therefore provides for greater security control.","Classifications

Data distribution techniques for load-balanced fault-tolerant web access,US6070191A,"
A server system for processing client requests received over a communication network includes a cluster of N document servers and at least one redirection server. The redirection server receives a client request from the network and redirects it to one of the document servers, based on a set of pre-computed redirection probabilities. Each of the document servers may be an HTTP server that manages a set of documents locally and can service client requests only for the locally-available documents. A set of documents are distributed across the document servers in accordance with a load distribution algorithm which may utilize the access rates of the documents as a metric for distributing the documents across the servers and determining the redirection probabilities. The load distribution algorithm attempts to equalize the sum of the access rates of all the documents stored at a given document server across all of the document servers. In the event of a server failure, the redirection probabilities may be recomputed such that the load of client requests is approximately balanced among the remaining document servers. The redirection probabilities may also be recomputed periodically in order to take into account changes in document access rates and changes in server capacity. The recomputation may be based on a maximum-flow minimum-cost solution of a network flow problem.","Classifications

Soft error decoding of steganographic data,US7466840B2,"
Soft error decoding is used to decode steganographic messages embedded in image and audio signals. Content signals with auxiliary embedded data are analyzed to make determinations about changes made to the signals to embed the data. These determinations are weighted based on the confidence that they are correct and input to an error correcting process. In this manner, error correction of the auxiliary data takes advantage of soft error weighting to more effectively recover the steganographic message from content signals that undergo distortion and/or loss transformations after being embedded with steganographic data.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for compressing data produced from a well tool in a wellbore prior to transmitting the compressed data uphole to a surface apparatus,US5381092A,"
A wellbore apparatus adapted to be disposed in a wellbore is electrically connected to a surface apparatus disposed at a surface of the wellbore. When disposed in the wellbore, the wellbore apparatus receives a plurality of input signals from an earth formation traversed by the wellbore which are representative of characteristics of the earth formation. The wellbore apparatus includes a data compression apparatus which receives the input signals and compresses the input signals prior to transmission of the compressed input signals uphole to the surface apparatus. The data compression apparatus compresses the input signals by first subdividing the plurality of input signals into a plurality of groups, where the number of the plurality of groups is much less than the number of the plurality of input signals, and then generating one value for each group. Therefore, a plurality of values corresponding, respectively, to the plurality of groups represent the compressed input signals transmitted uphole to the surface apparatus. In addition, since the plurality of values is much less in number than the plurality of input signals, the telemetry requirements needed to transmit the plurality of values uphole, relative to the telemetry requirements needed to transmit the plurality of input signals uphole, is substantially reduced.","Classifications

Loop-filtering method for image data and apparatus therefor,US6665346B1,"
A loop-filtering method for reducing quantization effect generated when an image data is encoded and decoded, and an apparatus therefor. The loop-filtering method includes the steps of extracting a flag indicating whether the image data requires loop-filtering using the distribution of inverse quantized coefficients (IQCs) of an inverse quantized image data and a motion vector indicating the difference between the previous frame and the current frame. The image data corresponding to the flag is then filtered by a predetermined method if the extracted flag indicates a need for the loop-filtering. Using the flags and an adaptive filter reduces the quantization effect and is useful to reduce the amount of computation required for the filtering. Also, the filtering can be performed through parallel processing without multiplication and division, so that the complexity of hardware can be reduced.","Classifications

Synthesis of anomalous data to create artificial feature sets and use of same in computer network intrusion detection systems,US8527776B2,"
Detecting harmful or illegal intrusions into a computer network or into restricted portions of a computer network uses a process of synthesizing anomalous data to be used in training a neural network-based model for use in a computer network intrusion detection system. Anomalous data for artificially creating a set of features reflecting anomalous behavior for a particular activity is performed. This is done in conjunction with the creation of normal-behavior feature values. A distribution of users of normal feature values and an expected distribution of users of anomalous feature values are then defined in the form of histograms. The anomalous-feature histogram is then sampled to produce anomalous-behavior feature values. These values are then used to train a model having a neural network training algorithm where the model is used in the computer network intrusion detection system. The model is trained such that it can efficiently recognize anomalous behavior by users in a dynamic computing environment where user behavior can change frequently.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for displaying question and answer data on plural displays,US5842869A,"
An electronic device for displaying question data and answer data includes an input device for entering commands, first and second displays, and a processor. The question data is displayed on the first display which is visible to an operator of the electronic device and on a second display which is visible from a position from which the first display is not visible, i.e., the position of an observer such as a student. The operator can selectively control the displaying of the answer data on each of the displays using commands entered on the input device. Entry of a first command causes the answer data to be display only on the first display so that the answer is visible only to the operator. Entry of a second command causes the answer data to be displayed on the second display so that the observer can also see the answer. In one mode of operation, the question and answer data for many questions is stored in a storage device, and the questions are categorized by level of difficulty or by subject. The operator selects the category of questions to be presented, and the question and answer data for each question in the category is automatically retrieved from the storage device for display on the first and second displays. The operator enters commands through the input device to display each successive question and to selectively control the displaying of the answer to each question on the first and second displays.","Classifications

High energy X-ray inspection system for detecting nuclear weapons materials,US6347132B1,"
An x-ray inspection system for automatically detecting nuclear weapons materials generates a high energy x-ray fan beam or a traveling x-ray pencil beam that traverses an object under inspection. An x-ray detector detects x-ray energy that passes through the object and provides a detected signal indicative thereof. The detected signal is processed to detect the presence of an area of very high x-ray attenuation within the object under inspection, which is indicative of nuclear weapons materials. Because of the high atomic number (Z) and high density of nuclear weapons materials Uranium and Plutonium, both of these materials attenuate (i.e., absorb) incident x-rays significantly more than ordinary materials. That is, very high Z materials such as nuclear weapons materials, produce no x-rays outside of their block of material because the x-rays are self absorbed within the very high Z materials. Therefore, these materials can be detected by a transmission detectors, or by combining the readings from transmission and scatter detectors, if a pencil beam system is employed.","Classifications

These harmonic reproductions allow a user to immediately extract aspect information between the planet whose major line is harmonically reproduced and other planets, whether or not harmonically reproduced. The longitude and time axes preferably have a common origin at respective longitude and time coordinates corresponding to the vernal equinox, thus permitting sidereal and tropical time information to be extracted from the chart by simple linear scaling of coordinates. The chart is rendered especially useful for astronomers by the provision of a two-dimensional reproduction of the stars located within a band about the ecliptic. The information is color coded in order that the different major lines and their harmonics be readily identifiable.","Classifications

Content-based filtering of multicast information,US6055364A,"
The invention provides a method and system for content-based filtering of multicast information. A set of sources (S) which desire to distribute potentially large numbers of categories of differing information each associates a content descriptor (CD) with messages including information in those categories, so that a set of recipients (R) can receive information in at least some of those categories. A mapping server (M) associates a multicast address (MA) and a content mask (CM) with each content descriptor, so that network elements (N), such as routers, in the network can distribute only those messages which are of interest to recipients in multicast distribution trees for those multicast addresses. Each source generates content descriptors for each differentiable topic in a tree structured hierarchy, and obtains a multicast address and a content mask for the broadest content descriptor it is capable of distributing. Each recipient obtains the associated source, multicast address, and content mask, for each content descriptor of interest, and uses that information to join the multicast distribution tree for that information. Each network element between the source and the recipient determines what information it must forward for further distribution in response to the content descriptors, content masks, multicast addresses, and multicast distribution trees.","Classifications

The present invention provides an intuitive interface, referred to as a semantic user interface (SUI), that enhances the operation of the current standard window-based interface in a manner that is simple, richer and natural. By leveraging all of the richness and power inherent in a user's language, the present invention provides an important tool that allows the personal computer to operate in a manner that is much closer to our natural way of interacting. A user is allowed to enter ""commands"" in his everyday natural language in order to control the operations of the computer. All commands are language-based and user-defined. These commands can be entered from any context of the user's computer (e.g., any application or operating system workspace). The commands allows a user to launch applications and navigate within applications by using language rather than clicks from a pointing device such as a mouse. It also allows the replacement of keystrokes with stored words or keystrokes. The system also keeps a complete archive record of all the text content the user provides as input, regardless of which application program or operating system window the user is operating in at the time. The combined set of all user defined commands and the memory of all the input text that is stored in the archive constitutes the personality profile and is transportable from one computer to another.","Classifications

Collimator for x-ray spectroscopy,US5768339A,"
The invention claimed is a collimator for x-rays and the fabrication process for said collimator. The collimator, in its preferred embodiment, displays the general shape of a tube, having two apertures, an entrance aperture and an exit aperture. The walls of the collimator tube are not parallel to each other but rather are paraboloidal in longitudinal section. The geometry of the collimator tube is, therefore, circular in transverse cross-section and paraboloidal in longitudinal section, thereby resulting in a tube whose entrance aperture is of a smaller diameter than its exit aperture. The collimator geometry described is referred to herein as a tubular paraboloid. The preferred embodiment comprises a first tubular paraboloid, or first reflector, and a second tubular paraboloid, or second reflector, each having an outer surface and an ultrasmooth, reflecting inner surface, the second reflector being of smaller diameter than the first reflector and being held by suitable means in assembly concentrically with the first reflector, thereby defining an entrance aperture and an exit aperture. Alternate embodiments may employ more than two nested paraboloid reflectors and may also comprise a truncated cone reflector at the entrance aperture to provide a two reflection figure. In addition, the process developed is suitable for fabrication of optics with very small apertures and ultra smooth interior reflecting surfaces. Many types of reflecting surfaces may be produced, including gold, copper, nickel, palladium and others. The process is a replication method, so that once a master surface for an optic has been prepared, subsequent copies can be inexpensively reproduced. Thus, the fabrication process described is best suited for the production of many identical optics, rather than one-of-a-kind devices, and in a variety of unusual geometries in addition to tubular paraboloids.","Classifications

A backside illuminated charge coupled device (CCD) is formed of a relatively thick high resistivity photon sensitive silicon substrate, with frontside electronic circuitry, and an optically transparent backside ohmic contact for applying a backside voltage which is at least sufficient to substantially fully deplete the substrate. A greater bias voltage which overdepletes the substrate may also be applied. One way of applying the bias voltage to the substrate is by physically connecting the voltage source to the ohmic contact. An alternate way of applying the bias voltage to the substrate is to physically connect the voltage source to the frontside of the substrate, at a point outside the depletion region. Thus both frontside and backside contacts can be used for backside biasing to fully deplete the substrate. Also, high resistivity gaps around the CCD channels and electrically floating channel stop regions can be provided in the CCD array around the CCD channels.

Improved systems and methods for coded aperture imaging of radiation-emitting sources. According to one aspect, the present invention is directed to reducing and/or eliminating the artifacts that are inherent in previous near field coded aperture imaging systems such that the improved sensitivity and resolution of these systems can be practically utilized.
A system and method of the present invention utilizes two projections of radiation from an object, the first through a first coded aperture mask pattern, and the second through a second coded aperture mask pattern, where a decoding array associated with the second mask pattern is the negative of a decoding array associated with the first mask pattern. Data from both projections is combined to produce a reconstructed object image that is substantially free of near-field artifacts.

More particularly, the present invention relates to improvements in the design and fabrication of coded aperture masks for use in coded aperture imaging devices. Improvements can be made to the resolution, for instance, by selecting smaller pixel sizes for the opaque and transparent elements of the coded aperture mask. Also, it is possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for near-field applications by selecting an appropriate thickness for the mask. The signal-to-noise ratio may be further improved by selecting the appropriate mask pattern based on the particular characteristics of the near-field imaging problem at hand.","Classifications

Digital pixel-accurate intensity processing method for image information enhancement,US5592571A,"
An ""image information enhancement"" technique for processing digital images objectively extracts basic image information classes which are intensity defined and produced by the contrast mediums used for the generation of the image. The technique has wide application in the general field of image enhancement and more particularly in the fields of microscopy, radiology, remote sensing, astronomy, robotics and machine vision and general image evaluation, quantitation and communication. The new image intensity processing technology of this invention makes possible a separation of the image intensity information into three objective distinct non-random spacial groups of ""large image features/background"" and small ""spacial detail"" and ""intensity detail"", and one group of random spacial information of the ""image noise"". ""Detail enhancement"" allows a recovery of intensity-defined image components, eliminated by a pixel-accurate smoothing process, through subtraction of a smoothed image from another smoothed image or the original image. The overall contrast range of the recovered information is equal to the applied smoothing factor and can be automatically brought to the full visual intensity range by linear contrast stretching. This has the advantage of maintaining detail contrast proportions which closely reflect the raw data characteristics. If high pixel accuracy processing is provided, ""detail slicing"" becomes possible. Two smoothed images, each processed with a different smoothing factor, can be subtracted providing the information difference between least smoothed and the most smoothed data set.","Classifications

Low-resistivity photon-transparent window attached to photo-sensitive silicon detector,US6025585A,"
The invention comprises a combination of a low resistivity, or electrically conducting, silicon layer that is transparent to long or short wavelength photons and is attached to the backside of a photon-sensitive layer of silicon, such as a silicon wafer or chip. The window is applied to photon sensitive silicon devices such as photodiodes, charge-coupled devices, active pixel sensors, low-energy x-ray sensors and other radiation detectors. The silicon window is applied to the back side of a photosensitive silicon wafer or chip so that photons can illuminate the device from the backside without interference from the circuit printed on the frontside. A voltage sufficient to fully deplete the high-resistivity photosensitive silicon volume of charge carriers is applied between the low-resistivity back window and the front, patterned, side of the device. This allows photon-induced charge created at the backside to reach the front side of the device and to be processed by any circuitry attached to the front side. Using the inventive combination, the photon sensitive silicon layer does not need to be thinned beyond standard fabrication methods in order to achieve full charge-depletion in the silicon volume. In one embodiment, the inventive backside window is applied to high resistivity silicon to allow backside illumination while maintaining charge isolation in CCD pixels.","Classifications

The Lobster Eye X-ray Imaging System collects (focuses) thousands of times more backscattered hard X-rays in the range from 40 to 120 keV (or wavelength λ=0.31 to 0.1 Å) than current backscatter imaging sensors (BISs), giving high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and penetration through ground, metal walls etc. The collection efficiency of Lobster Eye X-ray Imaging System is optimized to reduce emitted X-ray power and miniaturize the device. This device is especially advantageous for and satisfies requirements of X-ray-based inspection systems, namely, penetration of the X-rays through ground, metal and other material concealments; safety; and man-portability. The advanced technology disclosed herein is also applicable to medical diagnostics and military applications such as mine detection, security screening and a like.","Classifications

Near field imaging using a THz imaging system is realized by utilizing an interferometric imaging detector array that includes detector elements disposed on a surface curved, physically or artificially, to match substantially the curvature of the wave front for received THz signals. Generally, the near field is an environment wherein the distance to an object of interest is on the order of 10–100 times larger than the physical size of the THz imaging array. Typical distances from the object or target to the imaging array is anticipated to be in the 0.5 m–50 m range. Curvature of the detector array corrects a distortion problem in prior THz imaging systems that utilized planar interferometric imaging arrays based on a planar wave front assumption for received THz signals.","Classifications

At least two directional transducers are coupled to the surface of the body at different locations about the body in such a manner that their directional receiving patterns intersect. These transducers may be acoustic or electromagnetic transducers, but in any case are capable of receiving thermally-generated energy from inside the body and generating corresponding electrical signals. The intersection of the receiving patterns of the transducers defines a common volume which is relatively small, and the signals at each transducer originating from this common volume within the body exhibit a high degree of correlation. A multiplier receives the electrical signals produced by the transducers. A fixed or variable delay is interposed between at least one of the transducers and the multiplier. A low pass filter or integrator is connected to average the product output signal from the multiplier and thereby generate a correlation output signal which is a measure of the thermally-generated energy within the common volume of intersection of the directional receiving patterns of the transducers.","Classifications

A method and apparatus are provided for imaging and identifying concealed objects within an obscuring medium using radiation (optical, photo-acoustic, ionizing, and/or acoustic) optimized for imaging (e.g. temporal properties, spectral bandwidth, directionality, polarization, etc.). Radiation propagates through, interacts with, exits the medium and the object, and is detected/imaged. Image quality can be improved if radiation is collimated and/or if transmission and/or backscattered measurements from a number of perspectives are used to improved image reconstruction. Coupling materials can be employed during image acquisition to enhance radiation coupling as well as providing desirable absorption and scattering properties. Contrast materials and agents can also aid in the detection of concealed objects. Adaptive methods, e.g. using reference objects, including implementations based on the concept of guide stars, can improve the imaging process. The surface can be monitored and groomed to enhance the imaging process. Tomosynthesis techniques can be used to reconstruct images. Acousto-optic effects may be observed when both optical radiation and acoustic radiation are introduce into the medium. A laser vibrometry, speckle, or holographic interferometry imaging technique can be used to readout the acoustic waveform exiting the medium surface directly or after interacting with a deformable mirrored or reflective layer coupled to the medium. The medium may be prepared prior to imaging in order to reduce surface irregularities and roughness. Multilayer mirrors and capillary optics can be used to enhance imaging systems which use ionizing radiation. Resistance images can be obtained using probes to penetrate the medium.","Classifications

Apparatus and method for producing three-dimensional images,US5394151A,"
An apparatus and method is capable of acquiring useful three-dimensional ar images from an aircraft which travels in a curvilinear path to generate only a sparsely filled synthetic array. A motion measurement unit outputs position measurements as the aircraft travels in the curvilinear path. The system includes a motion compensation and timing unit and a wave transmitter which outputs chirped radar signals. An antenna coupled to the wave generator sends the chirped radar signals to a region to be imaged and receives scattered chirped radar return signals from scatterers in the region. These scattered signals are coherently mixed to baseband and digitized before being input to a processor. The processor includes a range processing unit, a memory unit and an estimator. The range processor receives and Fourier transforms the digitized return signals to obtain range profiles. The estimator completes the image formation process by three-dimensional back projection of the range profiles. It also estimates the location and complex strengths of scatterers and uses these to generate a side lobe free image.","Classifications

A coded aperture is placed in proximity of a patient's body and a 2D coded image is acquired in conventional manner. The basic data-acquisition geometry is similar to that used in various coded-aperture systems. According to one aspect of the invention, additional coded images are acquired with different spacings between the aperture and the detector. Alternatively, additional coded images could be acquired with multiple movable apertures or by varying the location of the aperture relative to a patient. Another aspect of the invention resides in the recognition that presently available computer algorithms can process these multiple coded images in such a way as to estimate the integrals of the 3D object over a set of parallel cylindrical tubes extending through the volume of the target object. Such “tube integrals” can be thought of as the output of an ideal collimator where the sensitivity is confined to a tubular region of constant cross-section.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for the correction of optical signal wave front distortion within a free-space optical communication system,US20030001073A1,"
A free space optical communication system is disclosed whereby the optics of a receive telescope are manipulated using adaptive optics to compensate for wave front distortion of a light beam transmitted by a transmit telescope. Wave front distortion is manifested at the receive telescope as a deviation from the normal, orthogonal orientation of the wave front of the transmitted light beam relative to its line of travel. This deviation may be detected, for example, by a wave front sensor, such as a Shack-Hartman sensor, which identifies the slope, or beam tilt, of discrete sections of the transmitted beam. The optics of the receive telescope can then be deformed in such a way as to cancel the wave front distortion and correspondingly reduce the resulting distortion of the received signal.","Classifications

The antennae may be radially directed toward a point within or on the surface of a human body for comparison with known temperature distribution data for that point and a given ambient temperature. Each frequency band may provide a plurality of adjacent noise measuring channels for measuring microwave noise naturally emitted by the human body. The apparatus measures short-term changes in, for example, core and body surface temperatures to establish a basal metabolic rate. Changes in core body temperature may be stimulated by the administration of food or certain organic and drug-related substances or stress to induce a change in basal metabolic rate over time. These changes correlate directly with a human subject's metabolism rate at rest and under certain dietary constraints and can be used to determine courses of treatment for obesity, metabolic disease, and other disorders. The apparatus can also be used to remotely monitor patients and subjects without physical contact.","Classifications

"Bi-directional, fast-timing, charge coupled device",US5693968A,"
A fast-timing bi-directional charge coupled device (""CCD"") is disclosed. The CCD operates at a much faster overall rate than conventional CCD's, while paradoxically slowing down the readout rate of the pixels. Lower power consumption is required, less heat is generated, thermal noise is lower, and digital noise is lower. The novel CCD is capable of 10-25 μsec timing resolution (or even faster). The configuration entirely eliminates the (formerly) rate-determining step of transferring data ""horizontally"" from the ""top"" of the CCD columns. Instead, the charges on columns are transferred either ""up"" or ""down"" in an alternating manner. For example, the charges in odd-numbered columns might be transferred one row ""up"" with each clock cycle, and charges in even-numbered columns might be transferred ""down."" This alternating charge transfer architecture is termed ""bi-directional."" There is no ""horizontal"" transfer of data off the chip; rather, each column outputs to a separate amplifier, preferably located on-chip. There is no need for a shutter in a low flux setting, although a shutter could be used for a high flux application. Without a shutter, the readout from each column is continual, without interruption; i.e., there is no ""dead time"" when light is not being detected. Assuming that light impinges on adjacent pixels in at least two different columns, the position and time of incoming light is reconstructed from the readouts of adjacent columns. The position of the impinging light is determined as the midpoint of readouts from adjacent columns; and the time of light arrival is proportional to the difference in readout from the adjacent columns. Unlike a conventional CCD, in a fast-timing, bi-directional CCD the clock time equals the time resolution of the overall image. Thus a relatively slow clock time of 10 μsec provides a very fast image time resolution of 10 μsec. In comparison to the 30 msec time resolution that is characteristic of conventional CCD's, the fast-timing bi-directional CCD can have a time resolution at least three orders of magnitude faster. The need for fast horizontal clocking is eliminated, as is the need for cooling. The fastest existing conventional CCD's can have a readout rate of about 106 pixels per second. The novel fast-timing CCD's can have a readout rate of 107 pixels per second, or even higher. Although the readout architecture of the novel fast-timing bi-directional CCD's is new, no new fabrication technologies are needed to construct the novel CCD's.","Classifications

"Method for correcting optical wavefront errors and optical system, such as a telescope, produced accordingly",US6426834B1,"
In a method for correcting optical wavefront errors in an optical system, the optical wavefront is calculated for different wavelengths and fields of view between the entry pupil (EP) and exit pupil (AP). Any phase differences are compensated by at least one surface (5, 7) compensating the phase differences in the beam path. A particular optical system, expediently in the form of a telescope, accordingly has a beam path which comprises the following: a first reflector (3), arranged along its axis (A), for reflecting a beam (1) incident along an optical axis (O) onto a concave second reflector (4) which throws the beam obtained from the first reflector (3) onto a third reflector (5), from which it is passed to a concave fourth reflector (6) in order to be reflected at an angle with said optical axis (O). Such a means (5, 7) for correcting the wavefront errors is provided in the beam path of such an optical system. The axis (A) of the first reflector (3) can optionally make an angle (α) of 0° with the optical axis (O); the means (5, 7) permits the correction of asymmetry errors resulting from the angular position.","Classifications

Method of fabrication free-standing thin films of polyimide,US5261977A,"
A method of fabricating free-standing thin films of polyimide by casting a polyamic acid solution onto a substrate that is free of parting agents and release agents is disclosed. The polyamic acid film is imidized on the substrate. The thickness of the polyimide film can range from about 200 Å to about five microns. A frame is adhered to the polyimide film while the film still attached to the substrate, and the frame, film, and substrate assembly is immersed in an aqueous based liquid bath for several hours wherein the liquid bath is free of reactive chemical agents. The liquid bath is heated, preferably, to a temperature within the range 30° to 100° C. The liquid is prevented from contacting the polyimide film within the interior region of the frame. Next, the assembly is removed from the water bath. The film is scored around the outside edge of the frame with a cutting tool; this cutting step may be performed either prior to, during, or after the immersion step. The frame is then detached from the substrate by first lifting only one side of the frame and then pivoting on the edge 180 degrees opposite. The process uses the frame itself to peel the film off the substrate, thereby producing a frame-supported and free-standing polyimide film. The present method omits the use of chemical agents, release agents, parting agents, and other detachment means whose purpose would have been to loosen the bond between the film and the substrate. The polyimide film may be metallized by vacuum evaporation or by sputtering to create a metal-polyimide composite. Free-standing thin polyimide films find particular utility in x-ray optics as bandpass filters and proportional counter entrance windows.","Classifications

Solid state photomultiplier,US4586068A,"
A solid state photon detector includes a semiconducting blocking layer with sufficiently low donor and acceptor concentrations that substantially no charge transport can occur by an impurity conduction mechanism. A semiconducting buffered layer is provided with a sufficiently high donor impurity concentration to create an impurity energy band and with a sufficiently high acceptor impurity concentration that an electron cannot be injected into and drift through the layer without recombining with ionized donors. A semiconducting active layer is positioned between the blocking and buffered layers with a sufficiently high donor concentration to create an impurity energy band. The acitve layer also includes a sufficiently low acceptor impurity concentration that a photogenerated electron can drift through the active layer without recombining with ionized donors. A first electrical contact with the blocking layer collects electrons without injecting D+ charge carriers, while a second electrical contact with the buffered layer collects carriers from the impurity band. The detector is designed to operate with a sufficient electrical bias applied between the first and second contacts to raise the field at some point in the active layer to the threshold for impact ionization of donor impurities. Under appropriate conditions, such detectors are capable of detecting single photons.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for using a color table scheme for displaying information on either color or monochrome display,US7714875B2,"
A method and system of determining the screen capability and rendering the appropriate display attribute is herein described. The present invention performs this task by using a color table, which contains a list of object types and a corresponding list of display attributes. The application program obtains the correct display attribute for the object by calling the color table, giving it an identifier of the object. The color table is indexed by the identifier of the object and a screen capability flag that is obtained, in one embodiment, from the operating system. The color table provides the display attribute for the specified object based on the screen capability flag. Advantageously, the application program does not need to know the computer's display capability. Furthermore, the application program needs only one piece of computer code, regardless of the number of display capabilities which are possible. Thus, memory space in the palmtop is conserved. In another embodiment of the present invention, the application program is allowed to modify the default values of the display attributes in the color table. Thus, an application program could use its own color to display an object if the default color is undesirable.","Classifications

Digital tracking platform for telescopes,US7982951B1,"
A digitally controlled platform for precise celestial tracking of astronomical telescopes, generally those having an independent pointing mechanism. A movable stage carrying the telescope is moved relative to a base by three digitally controlled actuators each of which determines the distance between a point fixed in the base and a point fixed stage. The base and stage otherwise are connected by a mechanism that holds a single point fixed in the base in coincidence with a single point fixed in the stage. It functions without approximation at any digitally specified latitude and longitude, enabling astrophotography with alt/azimuth mounted telescopes and diurnal tracking through the zenith. The digital controller may be a personal computer laptop running a multitasking operating system linked to the platform electronics by a Universal Serial Bus cable. Novel software design allows precise tracking, control, and calibration in spite of operating system and Universal Serial Bus latency.","Classifications

Passive microwave assessment of human body core to surface temperature gradients and basal metabolic rate,US8013745B2,"
A passive microwave thermography apparatus uses passive microwave antennas designed for operation, for example, at WARC protected frequencies of 1.400 to 1.427 GHz and 2.690 to 2.70 GHz (for core body gradient temperature measurement) and 10.68 to 10.700 GHz or higher microwave frequency (for surface body gradient temperature measurement) and a related directional antenna or antenna array to measure microwave radiation emanating from an animal, especially, a human body. The antennae may be radially directed toward a point within or on the surface of a human body for comparison with known temperature distribution data for that point and a given ambient temperature. Each frequency band may provide a plurality of adjacent noise measuring channels for measuring microwave noise naturally emitted by the human body. The apparatus measures short-term changes in, for example, core and body surface temperatures to establish a basal metabolic rate. Changes in core body temperature may be stimulated by the administration of food or certain organic and drug-related substances or stress to induce a change in basal metabolic rate over time. These changes correlate directly with a human subject's metabolism rate at rest and under certain dietary constraints and can be used to determine courses of treatment for obesity, metabolic disease, and other disorders. The apparatus can also be used to remotely monitor patients and subjects without physical contact.","Classifications

An instrument is provided which requires no complex computations or high degree of skill in aligning scales to accurately indicate the time of day from observations of the position of the sun, and to accurately locate the moon, the sun, and other stars and constellations in celestial space.
The instrument comprises a vertically adjustable stand upon which is mounted a support plane which may be rotated about a horizontal axis to accommodate alignment with the celestial equator. To the support plate is mounted a single rotary disk rotatable about a principal axis normal to the plane of the support plate. Inscribed upon the surface of the disk are an hour scale, a month-day scale, a right ascension hour angle scale, a local hour angle scale, a moon phase scale, a lunation scale to trace the phases of the moon, and a zodiac constellation display.
Integrally formed from and normal to the disk are a sunbeam aperture plate, a sunbeam trace plate, and a plate having a declination scale inscribed thereon and to which a space object pointer with a bubble level is rotatably attached. Inscribed on the surface of the sunbeam trace plate opposite the aperture plate are time equation graphs tracing the movement of the sun in both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. Sun declination scales and mean sun base lines corresponding to each time graph are also inscribed on the trace plate.
When the support plate is aligned with its face toward the north and parallel to the plane of the celestial equator, the rotary disk may be turned to a position where sunlight passes through an aperture of the sunbeam aperture plate to strike a time equation graph or a mean sun base line inscribed on the trace plate. A rotary meridian marker mounted to the support plate so as to rotate about its principal axis independent of the rotary disk may then be used to directly indicate standard time, daylight saving time, solar time, or mean solar time on the hour scale.
To function as a space transit, the rotary disk may be adjusted for longitudinal correction and right ascension, and the space object pointer may be adjusted for declination to locate the moon, sun, planets and other stars and constellations in space. Conversely, after the instrument has been directed toward an object in space, the instrument may be adjusted to indicate the right ascension and declination of the object. In addition, the constellations of the zodiac may be more generally located by means of the zodiac constellation display and a knowledge of the sun's declination during the month of concern.
The moon phase and lunation interval scales make possible the tracing of any moon phase throughout the current and subsequent years. Further, when the date of the moon phase is determined, the right ascension and hour angle of the moon at any given time during the phase may be acquired.","Classifications

High resolution telescope including an array of elemental telescopes aligned along a common axis and supported on a space frame with a pivot at its geometric center,US5108168A,"
A large effective-aperture, low-cost optical telescope with diffraction-limited resolution enables ground-based observation of near-earth space objects. The telescope has a non-redundant, thinned-aperture array in a center-mount, single-structure space frame. It employes speckle interferometric imaging to achieve diffraction-limited resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio problem is mitigated by moving the wavelength of operation to the near-IR, and the image is sensed by a Silicon CCD. The steerable, single-structure array presents a constant pupil. The center-mount, radar-like mount enables low-earth orbit space objects to be tracked as well as increases stiffness of the space frame. In the preferred embodiment, the array has elemental telescopes with subaperture of 2.1 m in a circle-of-nine configuration. The telescope array has an effective aperture of 12 m which provides a diffraction-limited resolution of 0.02 arc seconds. Pathlength matching of the telescope array is maintained by a electro-optical system employing laser metrology. Speckle imaging relaxes pathlength matching tolerance by one order of magnitude as compared to phased arrays. Many features of the telescope contribute to substantial reduction in costs. These include eliminating the conventional protective dome and reducing on-site construction activities. The cost of the telescope scales with the first power of the aperture rather than its third power as in conventional telescopes.","Classifications

Large-vocabulary speech recognition using an integrated syntactic and semantic statistical language model,US5839106A,"
Methods and apparatus for performing large-vocabulary speech recognition employing an integrated syntactic and semantic statistical language model. In an exemplary embodiment, a stochastic language model is developed using a hybrid paradigm in which latent semantic analysis is combined with, and subordinated to, a conventional n-gram paradigm. The hybrid paradigm provides an estimate of the likelihood that a particular word, chosen from an underlying vocabulary will occur given a prevailing contextual history. The estimate is computed as a conditional probability that a word will occur given an ""integrated"" history combining an n-word, syntactic-type history with a semantic-type history based on a much larger contextual framework. Thus, the exemplary embodiment seamlessly blends local language structures with global usage patterns to provide, in a single language model, the proficiency of a short-horizon, syntactic model with the large-span effectiveness of semantic analysis.","Classifications

Determining a natural language shift in a computer document,US5913185A,"
Language shift points in a computer document written in a plurality of natural languages are determined. An interval is defined on and moved through a text document in a computer memory, the interval contains a portion of the text in the document. As the interval is moved through the document for each position of the interval, a probability that the text in the interval is written in each of a plurality of candidate languages is determined for the position. For the first position of the interval, generally the beginning of the document, a first candidate language is classified as the current language if it has the highest probability of all the candidate languages within the interval. A language shift point in the document is identified where the relative probability of a second candidate language is higher than the current language at a new position of the interval. At this point, the second candidate language is classified as the current language in the document after the language shift point. The process continues to identify other language shift points in the document.","Classifications

System and method for identifying language using morphologically-based techniques,US6415250B1,"
A language identification system for automatically identifying a language in which an input text is written based upon a probabilistic analysis of predetermined portions of words sampled from the input text. The predetermined portions of words reflect morphological characteristics of natural languages. The automatic language identification system determines which language of a plurality of represented languages a given text is written based upon a value representing the relative likelihood that the text is a particular one of the plurality of represented languages due to a presence of a morphologically-significant word portion in the text. Preferably the word portion is the last three characters in a word. The relative likelihood is derived from a relative frequency of occurrence of the fixed-length word ending in each of a plurality of language corpuses, within each language corpus corresponding to one of the plurality of represented languages. Specifically, the automatic language identification system includes a language corpus analyzer that generates, for each of a plurality of word endings extracted from at least one of the language corpuses, a plurality of probabilities associated with the word ending and one of the plurality of represented languages. Each of the language corpuses represents a natural language and each of the probabilities represents a relative likelihood that the text is the associated language due to the presence of the associated word ending in the text. The relative likelihood is derived from a relative frequency that the associated word ending occurs in each of the plurality of language corpuses. The automatic language identification system also comprises a language identification engine that determines, for each of the represented languages, an arithmetic sum of the relative probabilities for all the word endings which appear in the text. The source language is determined to be the represented language having the greatest arithmetic sum of relative probabilities, provided this sum exceeds zero.","Classifications

Dynamic language model for speech recognition,US5384892A,"
A method of speech recognition which determines acoustic features in a sound sample; recognizes words comprising the acoustic features based on a language model, which determines the possible sequences of words that may be recognized; and the selection of an appropriate response based on the words recognized. Information about what words may be recognized, under which conditions those words may be recognized, and what response is appropriate when the words are recognized, is stored, in a preferred embodiment, in a data structure called a speech rule. These speech rules are partitioned according to the context in which they are active. When speech is detected, concurrent with acoustic feature extraction, the current state of the computer system is used to determine which rules are active and how they are to be combined in order to generate a language model for word recognition. A language model is dynamically generated and used to find the best interpretation of the acoustic features as a word sequence. This word sequence is then matched against active rules in order to determine the appropriate response. Rules that match all or part of the word sequence contribute data structures representing the ""meaning"" of the word sequence, and these data structures are used by the rule actions in order to generate an appropriate response to the spoken utterance.","Classifications

Natural language understanding system,US5794050A,"
The present invention interprets natural language input using common sense reasoning. The invention avoids the combinatorial explosion that has occurred in other natural language understanding systems. The invention uses modules for parsing, disambiguation, formal semantics, anaphora resolution, and coherence, and a naive semantic lexicon. The naive semantic lexicon is consulted by the parsing, disambiguation, formal semantics, anaphora resolution, and coherence modules to determine whether an interpretation alternative is plausible based on the world knowledge contained in the naive semantic lexicon. The parsing module employs both a top-down and bottom-up parsing strategy. The parsing module consults the naive semantic lexicon to build a structure from natural language input that has both semantic and pragmatic plausibility. The invention uses a psychologically-motivated naive semantic ontology that provides a means for classifying concepts. The lexicon relates word senses to the ontological concepts, contains word sense-specific common sense knowledge, and connects syntactic information with the meaning of each word sense. Using the natural language understanding of the present invention, a process is used for retrieving text that includes the steps of: 1) natural language understanding of a document base, 2) natural language understanding of a text retrieval request (i.e., query), 3) a comparison of the output of steps 1 and 2.","Classifications

"Natural language analyzing apparatus and method, and construction of a knowledge base for natural language analysis",US5424947A,"
A system for resolving structural ambiguities in syntactic analysis of natural language, which ambiguities are caused by prepositional phrase attachment, relative clause attachment, and other modifier-modifiee relationships in sentences. The system uses instances of dependency (modification relationship) structures extracted from a terminology dictionary as a knowledge base. Structural ambiguity is represented by indicating that a word in a sentence has several words as candidate modifiees. The system resolves such ambiguity by 1) first searching the knowledge base, which contains dependency information in the form of tree structures, for dependencies between the word and each of its possible modifiees, 2) then assigning an order of preference to these dependencies by means of a path search in the tree structures, and 3) finally selecting the most preferable dependency as the modifiee. The sentences can be analyzed by a parser and transformed into dependency structures by the system. The knowledge base can be constructed automatically, since the source of knowledge exists in the form of texts, and knowledge bootstrapping can be realized by adding the outputs of the system to its knowledge base.","Classifications

System and method for identifying the language of written text having a plurality of different length n-gram profiles,US6272456B1,"
A window of letters is identified within a text sample input. If the window contains matches to reference letter sequences (RLS) contained in multiple sets of n-gram language profiles (profiles), then the longest match is kept and scored for each language. Scoring each language is based on frequency parameters of the matched RLS in profiles for each language. The window is incrementally shifted through the sample and the matching and scoring is done on the letters within the window. At the end of the sample input, the language having the highest cumulative score is identified as the sample's language. Scoring may be improved by restricting the RLS within longer profiles to be full words, using two passes where the second pass disregards languages that are not scored near the highest scoring language during the first pass, favoring matched RLS within profiles of complete words during scoring, favoring longer matched RLS within profiles during scoring, and increasing a score of a match that does not frequently appear in many languages. The profiles may be enhanced by removing some of the RLS if the frequency of the RLS does not meet a predefined threshold and a variable threshold.","Classifications

"Method, system and computer program product for dynamic language switching via messaging",US6469713B2,"
Language, locale, and display change system messages are defined which contain language or locale codes for changing a display language in a user interface. An operating system language or locale property may be altered, or merely the language and/or locale property of a user interface for a specific application or dialog. When received, all subscribers registered as listeners for such language, locale, and display change system messages are notified. The system message may originate from a control dialog or from another application, and may be passed from one application to another or to dialogs associated with the receiving application. User interface dialogs or applications notified of the system message may reload the contents of displays, updating the user interface display to contain the contents of menu labels, help text, or dialog messages in the new human language or display text formatted in accordance with the new cultural convention. The system message thus permits a run-time change of the display language employed for a user interface. This in turn enables remote support by users employing different languages, setting user interface display languages based on user preference, and temporary transactional language switching.","Classifications

Image or graphic elements such as pictures, icons and clip art, are intercepted during transfer from a computer source to a computer destination, such as during a cut-and-paste operation. Embedded text within the intercepted element is optically recognized, and encoded text is extracted. It is determined if the language of the text matches a desired language of the destination. If not, a translation of the optically-recognized text data is performed, and the translated text data is rendered into image data. The image data is then substituted into the intercepted element to overlay or replace the original embedded text, thereby “translating” the image or graphic element to a desired destination language. The modified image or graphic element is then delivered to the destination, such as a document, program, file or data structure.","Classifications

Automatic language identification/verification system,US5689616A,"
A language identification and verification system is described whereby language identification is determined by finding the closest match of a speech utterance to multiple speaker sets. The language identification and verification system is implemented through use of a speaker identification/verification system as a baseline to find a set of well matched speakers in each of a plurality of languages. A comparison of unknown speech to speech features from such well-matched speakers is then made and a language decision is arrived on based on a closest match between the unknown speech features and speech features for such well matched reference speakers in a particular language. To avoid a problem associated with prior-art language identification systems, wherein speech feature are based on short-term spectral features determined at a system frame rate--thereby seriously limiting the resolution and accuracy of such prior-art systems, the invention uses speech features derived from vocalic or syllabic nuclei, from which related phonetic speech features may then be extracted. Detection of such vocalic centers or syllabic nuclei is accomplished using a trained back-error propagation multi-level neural network.","Classifications

A natural language (NL) analyzing system is provided with the capability to analyze NL expressions and to resolve ambiguities and present them to the user for verification of correct interpretation. A conceptual model of the system, relevant to the application in which the invention is implemented, is created (customizing the system) by the user, and is stored as a conceptual schema. The schema is built of logical facts representing entities (concepts) and relationships between entities, forming a description of the universe of discourse or object system in question. The entities of the schema have at least one external connection, namely to natural language terms in a vocabulary. The schema itself is completely language independent, though the components of it may have ""names"" expressed in a natural language such as English. There may be a second connection to the entities, namely where the system is used in a query system for relational data bases. In this case the entities of the schema represent objects in the data base, and thus there is a connection between the entities and those objects of the data base. The actual analysis of NL expressions is performed by a natural language engine (NLE) in cooperation with an analysis grammar and the schema. The analysis results in an intermediate, language-independent logic form representation of the input, which is paraphrased back to NL for verification. If the input is a query, there is a translation into a query language such as SQL.","Classifications

A method and apparatus for computer translation between a natural language, such as English, and a second language, such as the command language of a computer operating system, a job control language, a robot control language, a numerical control machine program language or subset of another natural language.
The system for an operating system interface performs semantic processing of natural language requests by applying cryptographic techniques and indexes to guide an Artificial Intelligence search and inference mechanism in a mapping process from the user request to the target command set. Other cryptographic characteristics such as frequency distribution of classes of words and letters are used to allocate and retrieve the information in the knowledge base. The system also utilizes a high speed cryptographic filter to reduce computational overhead. A crypto-signature is computed in this filtering process to permit fast and efficient pattern matching access and to interface the virtual memory system. Interpretation of requests having insufficient information or ambiguities is achieved by the use of information theory concepts of entropy and key equivocation in conjunction with a conversational mode.
The system also rewrites the knowledge provided by the user in a form of Extended-Microinstructions, that participate in the inductive mapping process and code generation for the desired secondary language. The Extended-Microinstructions define the structure, parameters, and order of execution of a series of general purpose procedures used in the mapping process of the natural language to the command set.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for language translation,US6233544B1,"
Methods and systems for language translation are disclosed. The translator is based on finite state machines that can convert a pair of input symbol sequences to a pair of output symbol sequences. The translator includes a lexicon associating a finite state machine with a pair of head words with corresponding meanings in the source and target languages. The state machine for a source language head word w and a target language head word ν reads the dependent words of w to its left and right in a source sentence and proposes corresponding dependents to the left and right of ν in a target language sentence being constructed, taking account of the required word order for the target language. The state machines are used by a transduction search engine to generate a plurality of candidate translations via a recursive process wherein, a source language head word is first translated as described above, and then the heads of each of the dependent phrases are similarly translated, and then their dependents and so on. Only the state machines corresponding to the words in the source language string are activated and used by the search engine. The translator also includes a parameter table that provides costs for actions taken by each finite state machine in converting between the source language and the target language. The costs for machine transitions are indicative of the likelihood of co-occurence of pairs of words in the source language, and between corresponding pairs of words in the target language. The transduction search engine provides a total cost, using the parameter table, for each of the candidate translations. The total cost of a translation is the sum of the cost for all actions taken by each machine involved in the translation.","Classifications

Computer-aided writing system and method with cross-language writing wizard,US7107204B1,"
A computer-aided writing system offers assistance to a user writing in a non-native language, as the user needs help, without requiring the user to divert attention away from the entry task. The writing system provides a user interface (UI) that integrates writing assistance with in-line text entry. When the user is unsure of a word's spelling or whether the word is appropriate, the user may enter a corresponding native word directly in line with the ongoing sentence. An error tolerant spelling tool accepts the native word (even if it is misspelled or mistyped) and derives the most probable non-native word for the given context. The spelling tool consults a bilingual dictionary to determine possible non-native word translation candidates, a non-native language model (e.g., a trigram language model) to generate probabilities associated with the candidates given the current sentence or phrase context, and a translation model to generate probabilities of how likely a certain native word was intended given the non-native word candidates. From these probabilities, the spelling tool determines the most probable non-native word translation and substitutes the non-native word for the native input string. If the user likes the non-native word, the user may simply continue with the sentence. On the other hand, if the user is still unsure of the non-native word, the user can invoke a sentence recommendation tool that allows the user to see the non-native word in a bilingual sentence pair to learn how the word can be used.","Classifications

Ranking parser for a natural language processing system,US7143036B2,"
A natural language parse ranker of a natural language processing (NLP) system employs a goodness function to rank the possible grammatically valid parses of an utterance. The goodness function generates a statistical goodness measure (SGM) for each valid parse. The parse ranker orders the parses based upon their SGM values. It presents the parse with the greatest SGM value as the one that most likely represents the intended meaning of the speaker. The goodness function of this parse ranker is highly accurate in representing the intended meaning of a speaker. It also has reasonable training data requirements. With this parse ranker, the SGM of a particular parse is the combination of all of the probabilities of each node within the parse tree of such parse. The probability at a given node is the probability of taking a transition (“grammar rule”) at that point. The probability at a node is conditioned on highly predicative linguistic phenomena, such as “phrase levels,” “null transitions,” and “syntactic history”.","Classifications

Voice language translator,US4984177A,"
A voice language translator, suitable for implementation in hand-held size, is disclosed. The voice language translator includes: a key pad (20); a display system (17); a language cartridge(s) (45); a voice recognition module (49); a voice synthesizer (47); a speaker (39); a microphone (41); and a programmed CPU (43). Prior to use as a translator, the voice language translator is trained to the voice of a user. During training, a series of words and phrases to be spoken by the user are displayed, or spoken, in the language of the user. As the user speaks the words and phrases, the voice recognition circuit produces a digitally coded voice pattern that uniquely identifies the way in which the user spoke the words and phrases. The voice patterns produced by the voice recognition circuit are analyzed and stored, preferably in the cartridge. Thereafter, during translation, when the user speaks a sentence, the voice pattern produced by the voice recognition circuit is compared with the stored voice patterns to determine the nature of the spoken sentence. The result of the comparison is used to locate equivalent translations stored in the cartridge. Preferably, only sentences in the form of instructions or questions are translatable. Also, preferably, each question or instruction ends with a specific word unrelated to the content of the question, such as PLEASE. Strings of words and phrases that make up sentences are combinable only in a logical manner. Illogical combinations of words and phrases are ignored. This is accomplished by creating ""banks"" of combinable words and phrases in memory, and controlling via the CPU program the pathways therebetween such that only logical combinations are creatable. If the translator does not understand a spoken word or phrase, a list of acceptable words and phrases is displayed. Positioning a cursor adjacent the desired word or phrase and depressing an enter key allows the desired word or phrase to be selected. The logical string combinations of equivalent translations are converted to audible sounds by the voice synthesizer and emitted by the speaker. If desired, a visual display, or an audible emission, in the language of the user can be made to occur before the translated emission takes place (or simultaneously with the translated emission) so that the user can be certain that the sentence to be translated has been accurately interpreted by the voice language translator. The voice language translator also includes provisions for testing ""trained"" words or phrases and correcting erroneous training. Further, the voice language translator includes provisions for transferring ""trained"" voice patterns from one translation cartridge (e.g., an English-to-French cartridge) to another translation cartridge (e.g., English-to-French cartridge).","Classifications

Method and system for natural language translation,US5768603A,"
The present invention is a system for translating text from a first source language into a second target language. The system assigns probabilities or scores to various target-language translations and then displays or makes otherwise available the highest scoring translations. The source text is first transduced into one or more intermediate structural representations. From these intermediate source structures a set of intermediate target-structure hypotheses is generated. These hypotheses are scored by two different models: a language model which assigns a probability or score to an intermediate target structure, and a translation model which assigns a probability or score to the event that an intermediate target structure is translated into an intermediate source structure. Scores from the translation model and language model are combined into a combined score for each intermediate target-structure hypothesis. Finally, a set of target-text hypotheses is produced by transducing the highest scoring target-structure hypotheses into portions of text in the target language. The system can either run in batch mode, in which case it translates source-language text into a target language without human assistance, or it can function as an aid to a human translator. When functioning as an aid to a human translator, the human may simply select from the various translation hypotheses provided by the system, or he may optionally provide hints or constraints on how to perform one or more of the stages of source transduction, hypothesis generation and target transduction.","Classifications

Natural-language interface generating system,US4688195A,"
A system for interactively generating a natural-language input interface, without any computer-skill programming work being required. The natural-language menu interface thus generated provides a menu-selection technique whereby a totally unskilled computer user, who need not even be able to type, can access a relational or hierarchical database, without any possibility of error. That is, the user addresses commands to the database system simply by selecting words from an appropriate menu of words which could legally follow in commands, so that the user inputs commands which are phrased entirely in English, and these commands cannot be misunderstood by the database system. The present invention provides an automatic interactive system whereby such an interface is constructed. The database is itself loaded in, and the interactive interface-construction system then addresses a series of queries to the user's technical expert, in response to which the user must classify, which tables in the database are to be used, which attributes of particular tables in the database are key attributes, and, in particular, what the various connections between tables in the database are and what natural-language connecting phrases will describe those relations.","Classifications

Optimizing compiler using templates corresponding to portions of an intermediate language graph to determine an order of evaluation and to allocate lifetimes to temporary names for variables,US5613117A,"
A compiler framework uses a generic ""shell"" and a generic back end (where the code generator is target-specific). The generic back end provides the functions of optimization, register and memory allocation, and code generation. The code generation function of the back end may be targeted for any of a number of computer architectures. A front end is tailored for each different source language, such as Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, C, C++, etc. The front end scans and parses the source code modules, and generates from them an intermediate language representation of the source code programs expressed in the source code. The intermediate language represents any of the source code languages in a universal manner, so the interface between the front end and back end is of a standard format, and need not be rewritten for each language-specific front end. A feature is a method for doing code generation using code templates in a multipass manner. The selection and application of code templates occurs at four different times during the compilation process: (1) A pattern select phase does a pattern match in a context pass to select the best code templates; (2) Tasks of the context pass use context actions of the selected templates to analyze the evaluation order to expressions and to allocate temporary names; (3) A bind pass uses the binding actions of the selected templates to allocate template names; (4) Finally, a code pass uses code generation actions of the selected templates to guide the generation of object code.","Classifications

Language identification process using coded language words,US5548507A,"
Provides a process which identifies the language or genre of a stored or transmitted document. The process uses a plurality of Word Frequency Tables (WFTs) respectively associated with languages/genre of interest. Each WFT contains a relatively few of the most common words of one of the languages of interest. Each word code in a WFT has an associated normalized frequency of occurrence value (NFO); use of NFOs increases the language/genre detection ability of the process. A plurality of respective accumulators are associated with the plurality of WFTs. All accumulators are set to zero before identification processing starts. The language/genre identification process receives a sequence of words from an inputted document, and compares each received word to all of the words in all WFTs. Whenever a received word is found in any WFT, the process adds the word's associated NFO to a current total in the associated accumulator. In this manner, totals in all accumulators build up into language discriminating values after a number of words are read from the document. Processing stops when either the end of the document is reached or when a predetermined number of words are received; and then the language/genre associated with the accumulator containing the largest total is the identified language.","Classifications

Multimodal natural language interface for cross-application tasks,US5748974A,"
A multimodal natural language interface interprets user requests combining natural language input from the user with information selected from a current application and sends the request in the proper form to an appropriate auxiliary application for processing. The multimodal natural language interface enables users to combine natural language (spoken, typed or handwritten) input selected by any standard means from an application the user is running (the current application) to perform a task in another application (the auxiliary application) without either leaving the current application, opening new windows, etc., or determining in advance of running the current application what actions are to be done in the auxiliary application. The multimodal natural language interface carries out the following functions: (1) parsing of the combined multimodal input; (2) semantic interpretation (i.e., determination of the request implicit in the pars); (3) dialog providing feedback to the user indicating the systems understanding of the input and interacting with the user to clarify the request (e.g., missing information and ambiguities); (4) determination of which application should process the request and application program interface (API) code generation; and (5) presentation of a response as may be applicable. Functions (1) to (3) are carried out by the natural language processor, function (4) is carried out by the application manager, and function (5) is carried out by the response generator.","Classifications

Constrained natural language interface for a computer system,US5369575A,"
A user/computer interface is described that employ a constrained natural language-form input. The computer employs a feedback method to reinforce a user's confidence and knowledge that the computer comprehends a query or instruction. The user interface initially parses a user's natural language-form input into a case frame. The case frame is then filtered into a goal-expression that comprises a verb and remaining syntactical portions of the input query/instruction. The system then paraphrases the goal-expression into constrained natural language-form and communicates the paraphrase to the user for confirmation that the computer system has correctly interpreted the user input. The computer also compares the goal-expression with prestored goal-expressions to determine a match and then performs an action in response to a match being found.","Classifications

Method of identifying the language of a textual passage using short word and/or n-gram comparisons,US7359851B2,"
A method and system identifying the language of a textual passage is disclosed. The method and system includes parsing the textual passage into n-grams and assigning an initial weight to each n-gram, and adjusting the weight initially assigned to a word or n-gram parsed from the textual passage. The initially assigned weight is adjusted in a manner proportionate to the inverse of the number of languages within which such words or n-grams appear. Reducing the weight assigned to such words or n-grams diminishes—without completely eliminating—their importance in comparison to other words or n-grams parsed from the same textual passage when determining the language of a passage. The method and system of the present invention appropriately weighs the short words or n-grams common to multiple languages without affecting the short words or n-grams that are uncommon to several languages.","Classifications

Fast update implementation for efficient latent semantic language modeling,US6374217B1,"
Speech or acoustic signals are processed directly using a hybrid stochastic language model produced by integrating a latent semantic analysis language model into an n-gram probability language model. The latent semantic analysis language model probability is computed using a first pseudo-document vector that is derived from a second pseudo-document vector with the pseudo-document vectors representing pseudo-documents created from the signals received at different times. The first pseudo-document vector is derived from the second pseudo-document vector by updating the second pseudo-document vector directly in latent semantic analysis space in response to at least one addition of a candidate word of the received speech signals to the pseudo-document represented by the second pseudo-document vector. Updating precludes mapping a sparse representation for a pseudo-document into the latent semantic space to produce the first pseudo-document vector.

Robust language processor for segmenting and parsing-language containing multiple instructions,US5652897A,"
Apparatus and method are provided for segmenting, parsing, interpreting and formatting the content of instructions such as air traffic control instructions. Output from a speech recognizer is so processed to produce such instructions in a structured format such as for input to other software. There are two main components: an instruction segmenter and a robust parser. In the instruction segmenter, the recognized text produced by the speech recognizer is segmented into independent instructions and each instruction is processed. The instruction segmenter receives a recognized air traffic control or other instruction, and segments it into individual commands. Utterances or other language are thereby broken up into their component instructions by detecting probable instruction boundaries. If normal processing fails, then robust backup processing is invoked, as a fallback after a fixed time per word has elapsed or a processing failure has occurred. The robust parser allows the system to extract information from utterances that are not necessarily well formed or may have extraneous comments in them.","Classifications

Graphical user interface (GUI) language translator,US5974372A,"
A method of translating screen displays of a user application program from a first base language to a user-selectable second language. The method is driven by program software which intercepts the messages created by a presentation manager of a WINDOWS operating system, the messages being used to form screen displays of the user application program on the terminal. Initially, the untranslated text is moved from a displayed screen to a translation table. The user, who need not be a programmer or computer oriented, enters a translation of the text into the same table via the keyboard, the table then being stored in computer memory. Upon subsequent operation of the application program the message, which forms the screen to be displayed, will be intercepted. Subsequently, a search of the translation table for the text in the intercepted message is conducted. The matched text is replaced with the second language previously entered in the translation table. The translated message is then forwarded for display on the terminal screen. The method can either translate all designated application screens upon start up of the application program or can be individually translated as they appear on the terminal screen.","Classifications

A system and method for efficiently and relatively inexpensively providing a capability of translating “Patient Session Information” comprising IMD data and patient data stored in IMD memory in one human language and optionally other patient data from other sources into another human language. The local language translation is effected by first employing an Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) converter for converting Patient Session Information from an initial format, such as a memory dump format, ASCII format, a waveform format, a numeric format, or a binary format, to an XML format, thereby providing XML formatted Patient Session Information. Then, the XML formatted Patient Session Information is subjected to transformation by a human language specific Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) stylesheet into XSL transformed Patient Session Information. The XSL stylesheet effects translation of the XML formatted Patient Session Information into a language understandable to the user in an HTML format or another XML format or another suitable format, e.g., PDF or SVG graphic image formats. The XSL transformed Patient Session Information is thereby rendered understandable to the user that selects the human language when the translated Patient Session Information is delivered as by visual display or print-out or audible presentation or storage depending upon a selection of the user. The translated Patient Session Information can be stored in the programmer memory or in the IMD memory or transferred or exported to another device or system interconnected with the programmer including a remote server accessed through the Internet.","Classifications

A technique for processing natural language text uses a data structure that includes structure data in the text data. The structure data indicates an autonomous punctuational structure of the text, a punctuational structure that is independent of the lexical content of the text and therefore can be manipulated without considering the meaning of the words in the text. The data structure can be a tree in which each node has a textual type such as a paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word. The data structure could alternatively be parallel data sequences, one with codes indicating the text's characters and the other with codes indicating textual types. The data structure is produced and maintained using a grammar of textual types, indicating for each textual type the textual types of units into which it can properly be divided. During editing, a text sequence is generated by applying rendering rules to the data structure, and the text is presented to the user based on the text sequence. Prior to generating the text sequence, information relating to punctuational features is propagated through the data structure. User signals requesting editing operations are applied to modify the data structure using operations rules, and the user's pointing or selecting signals are mapped onto the data structure. The modified data structure is checked with the grammar of textual types to ensure that it has an autonomous punctuational structure. A modified text sequence is then generated, and a modified text is displayed based on it.","Classifications

Menu-based natural language understanding system,US4829423A,"
A natural language interface for a computer system restricts inputs from a user to those which generate valid input sentences. The user selects a next input word from a menu showing which words are valid. When an input is selected, a parser uses a predefined grammar to determine which words are valid continuations after the selected word, and whether a complete sentence has been entered. Valid next words are presented to the user in menu form so that a next selection can be made. If an ambiguous complete sentence is entered, the interface allows the user to select the desired meaning therefor. The grammer can be context free grammar, and can use an associated lexicon to define elements therein.","Classifications

Natural language speech recognition using slot semantic confidence scores related to their word recognition confidence scores,US6567778B1,"
A stream of input speech is coupled as an input to a speech recognizer. The speech can be provided to the speech recognizer directly from a user or first stored and provided from a memory circuit. Each input word is recognized by the speech recognizer and a word confidence score is associated with each corresponding recognized word. The recognized words and their associated word confidence scores are provided to a natural language interpreter which parses the stream of recognized words into predetermined edges. From the edges, the natural language interpreter forms semantic slots which represent a semantic meaning. A slot confidence score related to the word or phone confidence scores for each of the words in the slot is determined for each slot. Based upon the slot confidence score, an ancillary application program determines whether to accept the words used to fill each slot. If the slot is rejected, the application program can request the user to repeat the information necessary to fill that slot only, rather than requiring the user to repeat the entire stream of input speech.","Classifications

Applying traps to a printed page specified in a page description language format,US5295236A,"
A trapping technique which accepts a Postscript or other page description language (PDL) file and outputs a file in PDL format having the correct traps. The input page is first divided into sub-portions, or tiles, and the tiles are individually processed by evaluating the input file in a corresponding clipping window. Each tile is then analyzed to determine where edges exist. The edge data is fed to an edge converter which produces a list of color transitions consisting of the analytic description of each edge and the color information along the sides of the edge. The color transition information is fed to a trapping analyzer which generates trap vectors in accordance with a set of desired trapping rules. The trap vectors are then converted to PDL form. As a final step, the trap vectors are added to the original PDL file. The final trapped page may be printed on standard typesetters without the need for special trap generator hardware.","Classifications

Process for sexing cow embryos,US5876942A,"
A rapid, highly reproducible and sensitive technique has been successfully developed for sexing the cow embryos, by method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against the amelogenin (bAML) genes located on both X- and Y-chromosomes of the Holstein dairy cattle. Results from DNA sequence analysis showed that there was only 45% homology between the intron 5 of AMLX and AMLY genes. Based on these sequences a pair of sex-specific primers, pbAML5XY(+) and pbAML5XY (-),were designed allowing to amplify a single fragment of 476-bp from the female cattle and two fragments of 476-bp and 341-bp from the male ones, respectively. The most important feature is that the precise sensitivity of sex-determination was confirmed to be reached as minimum template as trace amount of genomic DNA content in either a single lymphocyte or a single blastomere isolated from cow embryo at day-6 to day-7. Moreover, neither those of complicated procedures for purifying the DNA prior the PCR nor any extra pair of primers for serving as internal control is thought to be essential and the sex-determination of over hundred embryos can be completed at once within 4hrs.","Classifications

"Meat-containing, strip-shaped food product and method of making same",US8309157B2,"
A flexible, strip-shaped food product is made by comminuting substantially frozen meat and heating the comminuted meat to at least partially denature the meat proteins and cooling the cooked meat. About 4% by weight to about 45% by weight of wheat flour is admixed with the cooked meat, along with other ingredients, to form a dough. Use of the wheat flour unexpectedly increases tensile strength of the dough and products baked from the dough, and maintains flexibility of the strip-shaped food products over an extended period of time. Cooking of the meat in the presence of salt unexpectedly increases water activity of the pieces, resulting in a product that has a skin and a moist middle, while maintaining tensile strength. The dough is rotary-molded into strip-shaped pieces. The rotary mold may have angled die cups. The strip-shaped dough pieces are then baked and dried.","Classifications

Fossil fuel consumption is substantially reduced, even eliminated, and 100% of the cattle waste is treated in digesters wherein it is converted into medium-BTU gas (bio-gas), organic fertilizer and bio-compost. The ethanol unit serves the purposes of ethanol production, grain pretreatment to produce feed for the cattle and production of a thin stillage which is fed to the digesters. The grain is first processed in the ethanol unit, where the starch portion is converted into ethanol and CO2. The remaining portion is separated into the thin stillage and a wet cake which is fed directly to cattle as a superior ruminant animal ration which displaces certain traditional feed components, alters the standard starch to protein ratio, and significantly improves conversion efficiencies and meat/milk quality.","Classifications

The dry filtered product is assayed to verify the immunological activity of the product and to measure the distribution and concentration of pathogen specific antibodies. The dry filtered product is stored. Subsequently, a dose of the product containing at least a minimum weight ratio of immunologically active Ig is fed to the newborn animal to transfer passive immunity. Ion exchange techniques can be combined with ultrafiltration techniques to significantly increase the Ig concentration in the ultimate product while simultanously reducing the net cost of producing the product. They whey-derived product may also be used on a continuous basis as a food supplement for an animal to enable the immunologically active immunoglobulin molecules in the product to attack pathogens present in the digestive system of the animal.","Classifications

Process for reducing fat content of pork skin and products made therefrom,US6033715A,"
A process is disclosed for the calculated removal of fat from pork skin. Pork skin is subjected to tumbling cycles during which the pork skin is tumbled first in warm water and subsequently in warm water containing salt and concentrated laundry detergent. As this two step cycle is repeated, fat contained within the pork skin separates and is drained from the pork skin with the rinse water. The cycle may be repeated until the pork skin contains a desired percentage of fat. The process does not require that the pork skin be ground or otherwise comminuted in order to selectively remove fat from the material, nor does the process use harsh solvents or chemicals that might render the pork skin inedible or toxic. Because the process is all natural, the reduced fat whole pork skin is edible and may be formed into a variety of canine treats through additional processing and cooking. These canine treat products may include knotted bones, twisted products, chips, filled bones, sticks, patties and various ground products.","Classifications

The product is made by preparing chunks of lean meat substantially free of fat, gristle and sinew. The muscle scaffold network is slackened e.g., by multiple severing of the connective tissue of the lean meat chunks. These chunks then are massaged under reduced pressure to produce the protein exudate, while sufficient water is added to obtain a desired protein-to-moisture ratio. Fat trimmings are ground and blended into an emulsion which is simultaneously extruded with the lean meat chunks through separate but adjacent extrusion heads which may be shaped to produce a product resembling a steak, roast or other conventional cut of natural meat. The product has uniform, reproducible characteristics of appearance, size, weight, shrinkage on cooking, juiciness, taste and texture.","Classifications

A method is described comprising stunning a ruminant at a packing plant, and thereafter measuring tissue characteristics of the ruminant using a tissue imaging and analysis device prior to processing the ruminant to a carcass. Working embodiments of the method have used an ultrasound tissue imaging and analysis device, although other analyses also can be performed. The ultrasound analysis can be performed by one operator, or plural operators. For example, if the device is an ultrasound tissue analysis device, the step of conveying may first comprise conveying the ruminant to a position adjacent a first operator. The first operator applies an ultrasound image enhancing fluid to the ruminant's hide, and a second operator places the ultrasound tissue analysis device adjacent the enhancing fluid and performs ultrasound tissue imaging and analysis on the ruminant. The method can be used to, amongst other things, measure backfat and rib eye dimensions, obtain an ultrasound image, and determine rib eye area and marbling using the measured tissue characteristics. This data can then be used to perform grading calculations, such as to determine quality and/or yield grades. A method for processing and managing ruminants and ruminant products in feedlots and packing plants also is described comprising first measuring internal tissue characteristics and/or external body dimensions of ruminants at a feedlot. Information obtained concerning each ruminant is stored in a computer or on computer-readable medium.

Neutralization of food allergens by thioredoxin,US5792506A,"
Thioredoxin, a small dithiol protein, is a specific reductant for major allergenic proteins present in widely used foods from animal and plant sources. All targeted allergenic proteins contain disulfide (S--S) bonds that are reduced to the sulfhydryl (SH) level by thioredoxin. The proteins are allergenically active in the oxidized (S--S) state. When reduced (SH state), they lose their allergenicity. Thioredoxin achieved this reduction when activated (reduced) either by NADPH via NADP-thioredoxin reductase (physiological conditions) or by dithiothreitol, a chemical reductant. Skin tests and feeding experiments carried out with sensitized dogs showed that treatment of the food with reduced thioredoxin prior to ingestion eliminated or decreased the allergenicity of the food.","Classifications

Food supplement and use thereof for elevating levels of essential fatty acids in livestock and products therefrom,US7001610B2,"
This invention describes feed supplement, and processes which increase the amount of essential fatty acids in the milk, eggs, meat and other by-products from animals including dairy cattle, beef cattle, goats and poultry. The food supplement described herein includes specific fish meal, fish oil, algae or plant dietary supplements combined with a natural ingredient/coating mixture, which can be either talc, clay or combinations; or mixtures of talc or clay with flax sprout powder to achieve enhanced levels of the essential fatty acids in the milk, eggs, meat and processed livestock products from animals fed this dietary supplement. In ruminants, the natural ingredient/coating mixture prevents microbial degradation of the essential fatty acids in the rumen stomach of the animals fed with this composition, thus providing more of the essential fatty acids to the animal, for their use. This in turn results in improved concentrations in the milk, meat and processed products from these animals. Poultry fed with this food supplement also have a higher concentration of essential fatty acids in their eggs and meat.","Classifications

The present invention includes a method of formulating ruminant feed to selectively change a composition of milk produced by the ruminant. The method includes providing a fistula directly into an abomasum of the ruminant. A selected feed component at a selected level is introduced directly into the abomasum through the ingress. The selected feed component thereby bypasses other portions of the ruminant's stomach. The direct introduction of the selected feed component allows for changing a selected characteristic of the composition of milk. The composition of the milk corresponding to the selected feed component is then analyzed. The direct introduction of the selected feed component is repeated, if necessary, at other selected levels. The milk produced corresponding to the other selected levels is then analyzed. A selected quantity of the rumen inert feed component to be fed orally to the ruminant is determined by utilizing the analysis of the composition of the milk corresponding to the introduction of the selected feed component into the abomasum of the ruminant.","Classifications

Rapid, accurate and almost automatic determination of fat in comminuted meat products, such as beef and the like, is obtained by exposing a preweighed sample to microwave energy for a period of time sufficient to achieve a relatively constant chemical analysis in the residue. During heating, a substantial portion of the fat is melted, leaves the sample and is collected, while a substantial portion of the moisture is vaporized and released directly as vapor. The sample, its residue after heating, less released fat and moisture, and the collected fat are all weighed and the weight is recorded. By cooking the sample using microwave energy to the point short of decomposition of appreciable protein, fat, etc., some fat, moisture and protein remain in the residue. Accurate determination of these components is then calculated automatically because the residue is at a constant chemical analysis relative to the original composition which is directly related to the amount of fat and moisture rendered from the sample.","Classifications
