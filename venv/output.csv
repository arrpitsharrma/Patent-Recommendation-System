Methods for targeting solid tumor stem cells in a solid tumor using a notch4 receptor antagonist,US7850961B2,"Abstract
A small percentage of cells within an established solid tumor have the properties of stem cells. These solid tumor stem cells give rise both to more tumor stem cells and to the majority of cells in the tumor that have lost the capacity for extensive proliferation and the ability to give rise to new tumors. Thus, solid tumor heterogeneity reflects the presence of tumor cell progeny arising from a solid tumor stem cell. We have developed a xenograft model in which we have been able to establish tumors from primary tumors via injection of tumors in the mammary gland of severely immunodeficient mice. These xenograft assay have allowed us to do biological and molecular assays to characterize clonogenic solid tumor stem cells. We have also developed evidence that strongly implicates the Notch pathway, especially Notch 4, as playing a central pathway in carcinogenesis.","Classifications

Application of light at plural treatment sites within a tumor to increase the efficacy of light therapy,US6416531B2,"Abstract
Light is administered during photodynamic therapy (PDT) for an extended period of time at a plurality of sites distributed within the abnormal tissue of a tumor. A clinical study has shown that a substantially greater volume of abnormal tissue in a tumor is destroyed by the extended administration of light therapy from a plurality of probes than would have been expected based upon the teaching of the prior art. In this process, a plurality of light emitting optical fibers or probes are deployed in a spaced-apart array. After a photoreactive agent is absorbed by the abnormal tissue, the light therapy is administered for at least three hours. The greater volume of necrosis in the tumor is achieved due to one or more concomitant effects, including: the inflammation of damaged abnormal tissue and resultant immunological response of the patient's body; the diffusion and circulation of activated photoreactive agent outside the expected fluence zone, which is believed to destroy the abnormal tissue; a retrograde thrombosis or vascular occlusion outside of the expected fluence zone; and, the collapse of the vascular system that provides oxygenated blood to portions of the tumor outside the expected fluence zone. In addition, is possible that molecular oxygen diffusing and circulating into the expected fluence zone is converted to singlet oxygen during the extended light therapy, causing a gradient of hypoxia and anoxia that destroys the abnormal tissue outside the expected fluence zone.","Classifications

Video tumor fighting system,US4869247A,"Abstract
A destructive heat lesion is placed in any location in the brain. A patient's head is secured within a stereotactic frame. After a high resolution CT scan and angiogram or MRI, data is incorporated and analyzed by a computer. This information is then resynthesized and projected as a video image on a screen facing the surgeon. A small magnetic object, perhaps a ball, is inserted into the patient's head via a burr hole drilled through the patient's skull. Using, real time fluoroscopic data superimposed on the computer image of three-dimensional structures, the surgeon is able to control and manipulate the object through the patient's soft brain tissue to a position next to or inside of the tumor area. An energy beam is then fired at the object, causing the more heat efficient object to destroy the brain tumor area. This procedure is repeated until the entire tumor is eradicated by the highly localized hyperthermia. The above procedure can be used to deliver hyperthermia, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other agents or treatments to the brain and other parts of the body as well.","Classifications

"Method for determining if a tissue is a malignant tumor tissue, a benign tumor tissue, or a normal or benign tissue using Raman spectroscopy",US5261410A,"Abstract
A method for determining if a tissue is a malignant tumor tissue, a benign tumor tissue, or a normal or benign tissue. The present method is based on the discovery that, when irradiated with a beam of infrared, monochromatic light, malignant tumor tissue, benign tumor tissue, and normal or benign tissue produce distinguishable Raman spectra. For human breast tissue, some salient differences in the respective Raman spectra are the presence of four Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1078, 1300, 1445, and 1651 cm-1 for normal or benign tissue, the presence of three Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1240, 1445, and 1659 cm-1 for benign tumor tissue, and the presence of two Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1445 and 1651 cm-1 for malignant tumor tissue. In addition, it was discovered that for human breast tissue the ratio of intensities of the Raman bands at a Raman shift of about 1445 and 1659 cm-1 is about 1.25 for normal or benign tissue, about 0.93 for benign tumor tissue, and about 0.87 for malignant tumor tissue.","Classifications

The major problem with current direct delivery techniques of therapeutic reagents into solid tumors, especially of cells or large volumes of recombinant DNA reagents or drugs, has been resistance of the tissues to the influx of the fluid and/or cells, resulting in low quantities of the fluid and/or cells penetrating into and remaining in the tumor tissue to be treated. Increased penetration and/or reduced backflow and diversion through the point of entry, so that more material is introduced into and remains in the tumor, is obtained through the use of a viscous vehicle, most preferably having a similar density to tissue, for the material to be delivered. Preferred materials include solutions or suspensions of a polymeric material which gel or solidify at the time of or shortly after injection or implantation.

Diagnostic apparatus for intrinsic fluorescence of malignant tumor,US4957114A,"Abstract
This invention relates to a diagnostic apparatus and particularly to an apparatus for the diagnosis of malignant tumor and the method of using the apparatus for diagnosis. The apparatus employs an ultraviolet light source with an emitting waveband of 3000A-4000A. Light from the light source is transmitted through a bundle of quartz optic fibers to the surface of the tumor, whether benign or malignant, to stimulate it, which then generates a specific intrinsic fluorescence spectrum. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum reflected from the surface of the tumor is transmitted by a second bundles of glass fibers placed near it to a color resolution means, then processed by a scanning means and a circuit means, and displayed recorded by a display recording means. The display may be a graphic presentation of the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the tumor that is tested. If the graphic presentation displayed includes a single peak within the range of the blue color band, it indicates that the tumor being tested is benign. If however, a second peak appears within the range of the red color band of the graphic presentation it is a characteristic peak of malignancy, indicating the existence of a malignant tumor. The presence of the red color can be established by eye rather than a complex color resolution system.","Classifications

Tumor volume determination,US4856528A,"Abstract
A computer-implemented arrangement (apparatus and method) for semi-automatically determining from CT image data the volume of a tumor. A primary application is to determining a tumor volume for patients with hepatoma and primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. CT image data of a scanned organ, stored on a magnetic tape, is read into a computer. This data includes for each of plural slices of predetermined thickness a plurality of pixels defining the slice and a CT number representing tissue density corresponding to each pixel. An image of the first slice is displayed on a monitor. A region of interest (ROI) approximating an outline of the organ is automatically generated, which outline is visually modified, if necessary, by an operator to closely correspond to the organ's outline. The particular pixels within the organ's outline and the CT numbers associated therewith are stored as a local histogram of the slice, the local histogram including data indicative of the number of pixels within the organ's outline having each unique CT number. Local histograms, produced in a similar manner for each slice, are summed to generate a global histogram indicative of the number of pixels within the organ outline's of respective slices having each unique CT number. From the global histogram, a demarcation CT number distinguishing tumor tissue from normal organ tissue is determined. From the global histogram and demarcation CT number, the organ volume and tumor volume are determined.","Classifications

Tumor targeting with polymeric molecules having extended conformation,US5762909A,"Abstract
Enhanced drug delivery to tumor tissue is obtained by attaching drug molecules to elongated polypeptide carrier molecules several orders of magnitude longer than wide. These are chosen to have a high net negative charge. The carrier molecules are created by unfolding long polypeptides by a large degree of substitution with steric hindrance molecules, such as diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) with at least 90% substitution. This causes the conformation to be worm-like as evidenced by a measure of persistence length, with a diameter small enough squeeze through the pore structures of tumor tissue but not so small as to pass through pores of vessels in normal tissue. The length is determined by optimizing two processes, blood circulation lifetime, and tumor uptake. The elongated conformation may cause the complex to become entwined with stroma in tumor interstitium and become trapped. The complex molecules provides increased therapeutic benefit in effecting tumor tissue destruction, or may be used in enhancing imaging contrast depending upon the active agent attached to the carrier molecules. The enhanced concentration and retention of the complex molecules within the tumor reduces side effects of the active agent in other tissues.","Classifications

Glycosaminoglycan derivatives and their use as inhibitors of tumor invasiveness of metastatic profusion-II,US5262403A,"Abstract
The present invention comprises a method for impeding the formation of tumor metastasis or tumor invasiveness in a host. Such inhibition comprises administration to the host of a glycosaminoglycan derivative substantially devoid of anticoagulation activity and is an effective inhibitory of heparanase activity. Such a glycosaminoglycan derivative may be provided by purchase or synthesis as directed herein. Parenteral administration to a tumor-bearing host of the glycosaminoglycan derivative results in the exposure of host-borne tumor cells thereto. Such exposure to effective levels of the derivative results in the inhibition of tumor heparanase activity and a lessening of invasiveness and metastatic spread.
Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan particularly effective as a heparanase inhibitor and an anti-clotting agent, is a preferred glycosaminoglycan for derivatization. Upon derivatization according to the present invention heparin may be converted into a glycosaminglycan derivative substantially devoid of anticoagulant activity but yet being an effective inhibitor of heparanase activity. Mere reduction of heparin carboxyl groups results in the production of a glycosaminoglycan derivative inhibitory to heparanase activity but without substantially anticoagulant activity non-anticoagulating, heparanase-inhibiting glycosaminoglycan derivatives may also be prepared from heparin, for example, by: at least partial N-desulfation and then N-acetylation; or N-, O-desulfation followed by N-resulfation.","Classifications

Human tumor-associated thomsen-friedenreich antigen,US5110911A,"Abstract
Human tumor associated Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen is purified from adenocarcinoma conditioned media, adenocarcinoma cell detergent extracts or plural effusion fluid by affinity chromatography using an insolubilized TF-specific monoclonal antibody, MAb 49H.8. The TF antigen is a glycoprotein characterized by a non-cryptic Gal β(1→3) GalNAc epitope, a molecular weight in excess of 1,000,000 daltons, and extractability with perchloric acid, the epitope being sensitive to alkali and periodate but resistant to acid. A heterologous sandwich immunoassay has been developed for human TF antigen using a monoclonal antibody as the catcher and labelled peanut agglutinin as the probe. Since human TF antigen is shed by tumor cells, a positive determination of the TF antigen in a patient sample indicates the presence of cancer. The test can also be used to monitor the course of conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy by monitoring the amount of TF antigen in a fluid sample from a patient being so treated. Because of the sensitivity of the assay method, cancer can be detected in very early stages by the assay method of the present invention.","Classifications

Tumor classification as indication of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma,US5871925A,"Abstract
Markers on chromosome 2 are associated with cancer predisposition, as shown by linkage analysis, in a significant fraction of families with a history of colon and other cancers. Tumors from these patients progressed through the same series of accumulated mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes found in non-familial cases, but showed no losses of heterozygosity for the linked chromosome 2 markers. DNA from the tumors (but not normal tissues) in most familial cases revealed a consistent and distinct abnormality: rearrangements in short repeated sequences throughout their genomes. This abnormality suggests that a large number of replication errors had occurred during tumor development. Methods are presented for detecting the presence of the gene which predisposes people to have colon and other tumors and for utilizing this information for diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive purposes. DNA markers useful for such methods are also described.","Classifications

The invention relates to methods and compositions for causing the selective targeting and killing of tumor cells. Through ex vivo gene therapy protocols tumor cells are engineered to express an α (1,3) galactosyl epitope. The cells are then irradiated or otherwise killed and administered to a patient. The α galactosyl epitope causes opsonization of the tumor cell enhancing uptake of the opsonized tumor cell by antigen presenting cells which results in enhanced tumor specific antigen presentation. The animal's immune system thus is stimulated to produce tumor specific cytotoxic cells and antibodies which will attack and kill tumor cells present in the animal.","Classifications

Methods for enriching breast tumor cells,US5648223A,"Abstract
The present invention relates to methods of enriching breast tumor cells from a patient's body fluids. In particular, it relates to the use of a cell-trap centrifugation tube containing a specific density gradient solution adjusted to a specific density to enrich for breast tumor cells from a cell mixture. The tube allows the desired cell population to be collected by decantation after centrifugation to minimize cell loss and maximize efficiency. In addition, the method can be further simplified by density-adjusted cell sorting which uses cell type-specific binding agents such as antibodies and lectins linked to carrier particles to impart a different density to the non-tumor or tumor cell populations allowing the breast tumor cells to be separated from the non-tumor cells in a more convenient manner. The rapid breast tumor cell enrichment method described herein has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, detection of tumor cells by molecular and immunochemical means, and purging of tumor cells from an autologous bone marrow cell preparation prior to re-infusion.","Classifications

Human monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies,US6140470A,"Abstract
Human monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies are isolated from fusion phage single-chain Fv and VH antibody libraries constructed from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of immunized cancer patients. Antibodies that bind to tumor cells of the same kind as the patient's are selected, and antibodies that also bind to a human normal cell type are removed. The remaining fusion phage antibodies are cloned and then are tested for binding to at least two normal human cell types. Antibodies that fail to bind to the normal cells are further tested for binding to a panel of tumor cells, typically including the original tumor type and several related and unrelated tumors. Human monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to the original tumor or also to some other tumors, or that bind to the original tumor and cells from the same developmental lineage, are obtained and sequenced. The selected antibodies can be used to design molecules which are potentially useful for various diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The single-chain Fv and VH libraries from cancer patients are also being used to select antibodies against other targets, such as endothelial cells, which have diagnostic and clinical applications.","Classifications

Injectable thermal balls for tumor ablation,US6423056B1,"Abstract
A method of tumor ablation using injectable thermal-sensing balls. A catheter system (115) is used to inject a slurry (134) of thermal-sensing balls (136) into a tumor (122) located in, for example, a liver (120). The catheter system (115) comprises a catheter (128) and a specialized syringe (129) consisting of a housing (130) and a plunger (132). The housing (130) includes a cylindrical chamber having the slurry (134) of thermal-sensing balls (136). The catheter (128) is inserted retrograde into the femoral artery and passed to the site of the tumor (122). The hepatic artery (124) branches into smaller vessels, one of which is a tumor artery (126) which feeds the tumor (122). The tip of the catheter (128) is placed in the tumor artery (126) guided by conventional fluoroscopy. The injected balls (136) then receive energy from an external control system (110). The system (110) comprises a control panel (114) as an operator interface for controlling the system (110) and reading data therefrom. A CPU (112) is used for control and monitor of the operation, and transmits power and signals to the injected balls (136) via a radiating antenna (118), which energy is converted into heat to increase the temperature of the tumor (122). The temperature of the balls (136) can then be read from one or more onboard temperature sensors, and displayed to the operator for accurate control of the tumor temperature.","Classifications

RUNX3 gene showing anti-tumor activity and use thereof,US7368255B2,"Abstract
The present invention relates to a RUNX3 gene showing anti-tumor activity which is essentially involved in TGF-β dependent-programmed cell death (apoptosis) and use thereof. In addition, the present invention finds that the RUNX3 gene expression is suppressed in the various gastric cancer and lung cancer cell lines. The suppression of the RUNX3 gene expression is due to hyper-methylation of CpG island located around RUNX3 exon (1). The RUNX3 gene and its gene product of the present invention can be used effectively for the development of anti-cancer agents. CpG island around RUNX3 exon (1) could also be used not only for the development of anti-cancer agents which regulate the abnormal DNA methylation and there by induce RUNX3 expression but also for the development of methods for cancer diagnosis by measuring the abnormal DNA methylation.","Classifications

Method for selection of primate tumor-associated antigens suitable as in vivo targets for antibodies,US5049373A,"Abstract
The present invention is a process for the selection of antigens which are suitable targets for in vivo antibody localization in human tumors or other altered (or diseased) tissue. The process provides a simplified and rapid technique for discovering useful in vivo targets for antibodies and is useful in cancer detection and therapy in humans or other primates, whether or not the antigens are specific to tumors. More specifically, the invention relates to a process for the selection of antigens suitable as targets for antibodies which localize in a tumor in vivo in which antibodies are first prepared distinguishable from those present in the animal in which biofiltration is to occur and that bind to antigens present in the tumor to be targeted. These antibodies are then injected into a non-tumor-bearing primate, into a tumor-bearing animal, and into a non-tumor bearing animal of the same species as the tumor-bearing animal to permit biofiltration of the antibodies. The biofiltered antibodies are next recovered from each of the non-tumor-bearing primate, the tumor-bearing animal, and the non-tumor-bearing animal and are employed to identify antigens whose antibodies are not retained in vivo in the primate and the non-tumor-bearing animal. The antibodies that are not retained in vivo by the non-tumor-bearing primate and the non-tumor bearing animal are then compared with those antibodies that are actually retained in vivo in the tumor-bearing animal to identify the antigens corresponding to those antibodies that are selectively retained in the tumor-bearing animal. In an alternative process, the tumor-bearing animal may be replaced by a perfusable surgically removed human organ bearing a tumor, and the non-tumor-bearing animal may be replaced by a surgically removed normal organ. Passage through a primate, however, remains the method of choice for selecting antigens whose antibodies are unabsorbed in vivo.","Classifications

It is important that the lipophilic group and hydrophilic group are bound to one and the same carbon atom; if they are separated from each other, no sufficient effect is obtained. Thus, the sensitizer possesses both lipophilicity and hydrophilicity. This sensitizer has a function of promoting acoustic cavitation and a function of revealing an antitumor effect and is an agent highly accumulable in tumor tissues. Thus, this sensitizer is highly selective for tumor tissues and enables the treatment of malignant tumor using ultrasound.","Classifications

Method for the treatment of tumors with β-glucuronidase activity dependent pharmaceuticals,US4337760A,"Abstract
Hyperacidified tumors having high β-glucuronidase activity can be treated with glucuronides with aglycones toxic to the tumor cells with great safety toward the rest of the body by first administering an alkalinizing agent in an amount sufficient to maintain the pH level of non-tumor tissues at approximately 7.4 during the glucuronide treatment. This will cause inactivation of β-glucuronidase activity in the rest of the body. When nitrile-containing aglycones are used sodium thiosulfate is also administered to avoid cyanide poisoning. Novel glucuronides are disclosed the aglycones of which exert a higher toxic effect in an acid environment or are water-soluble only in an alkaline environment. Such compounds have particular utility with the above process. By substituting radioisotopes into the aglycone, diagnosis and in situ radiation therapy may be accomplished. Bacterial cells having β-glucuronidase activity may also be diagnosed and treated in accordance with the present invention. A urine test is disclosed to determine the amount of free glucuronic acid in the urine which is an indication of the presence of a tumor in the body having high β-glucuronidase activity. Novel methods of synthesizing the glucuronide used in the present invention are also disclosed.","Classifications

Use of cyclopamine in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and other tumors,US7893078B2,"Abstract
This invention concerns the use of cyclopamine in vivo on basal cell carcinomas (BCC's) to achieve therapeutic effect by causing differentiation of the tumor cells and, at the same time, apoptotic death and removal of these tumor cells while preserving the normal tissue cells, including the undifferentiated cells of the normal epidermal basal layer and hair follicles. Causation of apoptosis by cyclopamine is by a non-genotoxic mechanism and thus unlike the radiation therapy and most of the currently used cancer chemotherapeutics which act by causing DNA-damage. These novel effects, previously unachieved by a cancer chemotherapeutic, make the use of cyclopamine highly desirable in cancer therapy, in the treatment of BCC's and other tumors that use the hedgehog/smoothened signal transduction pathway for proliferation and prevention of apoptosis.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for accurately directing a therapeutic radiation beam to a tumor or the like within a human body, including the implantation at the tumor of a source emitting radioactive rays traveling in a straight line therefrom, sensing this ray emission to determine a straight line path to the tumor, and directing the radiation beam toward the tumor by having the center line of the radiation beam coincide with the straight line path determined from the ray emitting source. Preferably, a radioactive isotope is implanted in the tumor as the source, and a collimating tubular channel member is selectively mounted on the radiation head of a radiation teletheraphy machine with the axis of the channel member coinciding with the center of the beam from the radiation head. One end of the channel member is open to receive rays emitted from the implanted source and the other end is associated with a device for detecting these rays. The detecting device produces an electrical signal in response to the rays sensed, this electrical signal being greater as the straight line path of emitted rays come into coincidence with the axis of the opening in the channel member, and the magnitude of the electrical signal is visually displayed. The teletherapy machine operator manipulates either the patient or the radiation head until the displayed signal indicates a maximum magnitude, removes the channel member and energizes the radiation head.","Classifications

"Methods, systems and products for predicting response of tumor cells to a therapeutic agent and treating a patient according to the predicted response",US20140127238A1,"Abstract
The invention provides methods for treating patients which methods comprise methods for predicting responses of cells, such as tumor cells, to treatment with therapeutic agents. These methods involve measuring, in a sample of the cells, levels of one or more components of a cellular network and then computing a Network Activation State (NAS) or a Network Inhibition State (NIS) for the cells using a computational model of the cellular network. The response of the cells to treatment is then predicted based on the NAS or NIS value that has been computed. The invention also comprises predictive methods for cellular responsiveness in which computation of a NAS or NIS value for the cells (e.g., tumor cells) is combined with use of a statistical classification algorithm. Biomarkers for predicting responsiveness to treatment with a therapeutic agent that targets a component within the ErbB signaling pathway are also provided.","Classifications

Individualized patient-specific anti-cancer antibodies,US6180357B1,"Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for producing patient specific anti-cancer antibodies using a novel paradigm of screening.

The invention further relates to the process by which the antibodies are made and to their methods of use. The antibodies can be made specifically for one tumor derived from a particular patient and are selected on the basis of their cancer cell cytotoxicity and simultaneous lack of toxicity for non-cancerous cells. The antibodies can be used in aid of staging and diagnosis of a cancer, and can be used to treat tumor metastases. The anti-cancer antibodies can be conjugated to red blood cells obtained from that patient and re-infused for treatment of metastases based upon the recognition that metastatic cancers are usually well vascularized and the delivery of anti-cancer antibodies by red blood cells can have the effect of concentrating the antibodies at the site of the tumor.","Classifications

Method for imbuing individuals with religious faith by combining scriptural and biographical readings,US20070132166A1,"
A method and resulting product of generating a bible torah or other religious text personalized to an intended recipient. The person giving the bible selects a characterization of a bible, such as a cowboy bible, truck driver's bible, lawyer's bible, children's bible, woman's bible and the like. Then the giver selects an age group of the intended recipient of the bible. Based on this information the system then presents a form for the giver to select from a list of problems experienced by said intended recipient. The giver is then given an opportunity to select additional passages from the bible or other sacred texts to be highlighted. A personalized message with sections highlighted which related to an intended recipients age and problems. This message can be a bound volume produced by the steps of feeding lightweight paper through a printer, printing using an inkjet technique or other relatively thinly deposited ink to print on said paper to result in producing printed paper, and binding said printed paper into a volume. The inventive combination may incorporate lightweight or ordinary paper in one volume of a scriptural or underlying religious text (such as the Holy Bible, the Torah, or the Qur'an) and a biographical text detailing the triumphs and hardships of the life of either a celebrated public figure or an extraordinary but seemingly every-day character. By cross-referencing these two texts, and packaging them in a single volume form where they can easily be flipped between, the teachings of a particular religious faith can be made more readily accessible to the public at large.","Classifications

A universal machine translator of arbitrary languages enables the semantic, or meaningful, translation of arbitrary languages with zero loss of meaning of the source language in the target language translation, which loss is typical in prior art human and machine translations. The universal machine translator embodies universal transformations itself and comprises the means for identifying high-level grammatical constructions of a source language word stream, constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the source language high-level word stream, decomposing source and target languages into universal moments of meaning, or epistemic instances, translating the epistemic moments of source and target languages with substantially no loss in meaning, constructing a grammatical world model of the syntax of the target language high-level word stream, optionally adjusting the target language syntax to comply with a preferred target language grammar, and generating the translated target language word stream. The universal machine translator also comprises the means to embody arbitrary sensory/motor receptions and transmissions of arbitrary word streams, which allows universally translated communications to occur among human beings and machines.","Classifications

Medical network management system and process,US5471382A,"
In a medical network management system (NMS) (20), health plan beneficiaries access a team of health care professionals over the telephone to help them assess their health needs and select appropriate care. The NMS (20) has a patient assessment component (22). The patient assessment component consists of a set of information tools which are used by health care professionals to assess patient conditions and assist in the selection of health care services and to help patients find appropriate care at the appropriate time. The tools include a comprehensive, automated set of proprietary assessment algorithms (26) which are based on branched chain algorithms utilizing Bayes theorem. These unique, clinical tools enable a trained nurse or other health care professional to sort patients into different risk categories, safely and effectively without requiring a medical diagnosis. Patients can then be guided to an appropriate level and type of care for their problem(s) based on their level of risk and set of potential needs.","Classifications

Method and computer-based system for non-probabilistic hypothesis generation and verification,US7062508B2,"
The invention provides a method, apparatus and algorithm for data processing that allows for hypothesis generation and the quantitative evaluation of its validity. The core procedure of the method is the construction of a hypothesis-parameter, acting as an “ego” of the non-biological reasoning system. A hypothesis-parameter may be generated either based on totality of general knowledge facts as a global description of data, or by a specially designed “encapsulation” technique providing for generation of hypothesis-parameters in unsupervised automated mode, after which a hypothesis-parameter is examined for concordance with a totality of parameters describing objects under analysis. The hypothesis examination (verification) is done by establishing a number of copies of a hypothesis-parameter that may adequately compensate for the rest of existing parameters so that the clustering could rely on a suggested hypothesis-parameter. The method of this invention is based on the principle of the information thyristor and represents its practical implementation.","Classifications

"Method for Teaching Individuals About the Comprehension of Religious Texts by Synchronizing Contemporaneous Print, Visual and Audio Learning Opportunities",US20170301254A1,"
A method and resulting product of generating a bible torah or other religious text personalized to an intended recipient. The person giving the bible selects a characterization of a bible, such as a cowboy bible, truck driver's bible, lawyer's bible, children's bible, woman's bible and the like. Then the giver selects an age group of the intended recipient of the bible. Based on this information the system then presents a form for the giver to select from a list of problems experienced by said intended recipient. The giver is then given an opportunity to select additional passages from the bible or other sacred texts to be highlighted. A personalized message with sections highlighted which related to an intended recipients age and problems. This message can be a bound volume produced by the steps of feeding lightweight paper through a printer, printing using an inkjet technique or other relatively thinly deposited ink to print on said paper to result in producing printed paper, and binding said printed paper into a volume. The inventive combination may incorporate lightweight or ordinary paper in one volume of a scriptural or underlying religious text (such as the Holy Bible, the Torah, or the Qur'an) and a biographical text detailing the triumphs and hardships of the life of either a celebrated public figure or an extraordinary but seemingly every-day character. By cross-referencing these two texts, and packaging them in a single volume form where they can easily be flipped between, the teachings of a particular religious faith can be made more readily accessible to the public at large.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for recommending a match to another,US7085806B1,"
The present invention comprises a method and apparatus for locating and recommending a match to another. The invention provides people with a way to take an active role in matchmaking between a friend, family member or client of theirs and a prospect date from a database of prospect-users. For example, users may be provided with the ability to review a repository of users who have registered with a dating service (referred to as prospect-users) in order to search for a person who may be compatible with a friend or associate of the user performing the search (referred to as a searching-user). If the searching-user locates a prospect-user whom the searching-user thinks may be of interest to the searching-user's friend or associate (referred to as a client-user), the searching-user may recommend that person to the prospect-user. Thus, the invention provides a way to transmit a recommendation message to the prospect-user via a communication conduit such as a computer network. After viewing an associated profile on the client-user, the prospect-user may respond to the recommendation message by sending a response message to the client-user. The client-user may then view a profile on the prospect-user and elect to reply to the prospect-user's response message. If all of the parties involved indicate a willingness to meet, the system provides a way for the parties to contact one another.","Classifications

Methods using social topical adaptive networking system,US20140236953A1,"
A machine-implemented social networking system builds up and repeatedly refreshes a hierarchy tree containing topic nodes. New nodes are added as new topics emerge in online public forums. Each topic node can link to an on-topic real time chat room whose occupants are currently discussing the topic of the node. A chat room can be pointed to by more than one node if the room is discussing multiple topics. Rooms can migrate from node to node as room topic dynamically changes. A system user who explicitly or inferentially wishes to be invited into a chat room which is on-topic with what the user is currently focused upon can do so by use of a node-seeking automated process. The process operates in the background and seeks out nodes of the hierarchy tree that currently have topics appearing to be the same as or similar to what topics the user appears to have in mind. Content browsing experience of the user is enhanced by addition of an invitations displaying subsystem that automatically invites him or her to co-compatible chat rooms currently discussing the topic(s) the user appears to have in mind. One of the many topics that a user may inferentially have in mind is that of being at a given location as reported by the user's GPS and wondering what best to do at that location and time.","Classifications

A would-be subscriber first specifies profile information including authentication information, information relating to qualities desired in a friend and mate, the relative importance of the respective categories, and a screen image icon. The profile information is stored in a database associate with a web server hosting the dating site. The subscriber can then log onto the site and advantage the of chat room environments featured at the site. Rooms are hierarchically organized into lobbies and sub-lobbies corresponding to topics and sub-topics of discussion. In addition, the lobby and sub-lobby screens indicate the concentration of compatible participants in the rooms of corresponding lobbies and sub-lobbies, thus allowing easy navigation to a desirable room. In addition to manual navigation, the site features automatic navigation allowing the user to find a chat room with compatible participants automatically once a sub-lobby is selected. Upon participating in a chat session, the user and a participant may choose a “virtual date” option featured at the site to take advantage of a private chat environment and to view a private, date-related video clip. “Physical Attractiveness” criteria also permit the subscriber to screen members in the database based on community ratings of the physical attractiveness of the members and to limit access to the subscriber's profile to members having a physical attractiveness ranking within a user-selected range around that of the physical attractiveness ranking for the subscriber.","Classifications

Following such dissemination, the encoded content is played on a playback console, such as a radio, television, or related peripheral content playback device. A device connected to or incorporated within the playback console, both extracts the encoded meta data from the encoded content and transmits the resulting decoded meta data and related information via an attached short-range wireless transceiver to a target device (e.g. a short-range wireless enabled cellular phone). Thereafter, the user's target device allows the user to view relevant portions of the relayed data package as a textual message on the display of the target device, and respond to this message by submitting a user response via the target device keypad. The target device sends a textual message response (incorporating the user response and associated data) via the target device's wireless network's short message service (or equivalent) to an entity, such as the interactive communication system operator, which may thereafter act upon the textual message response so received. A further act of the entity could involve the entity auditing, storing, and analyzing the data relating to the textual message response, forwarding data related to the textual message response to an appropriate further entity, or initiating a subsequent communication back toward the user of the short-range wireless enabled cellular phone, or any combination thereof. The content brokerage engine can also be used for the matching of content and meta data in communication systems distinct from and separate to the interactive communication system.","Classifications

Speed--the Mach Factor--accounts for up to 50% of the total values in the games. Part I of the games of the invention declares what I call Vectorial games and game-systems. This group is divided into three categories: miniature Mancala-like games, pyramidic games and tangramatic games. Part II relates to games which evidence new and improved formats, apparatus and methods for making and playing traditional Mancala type games. Several examples illustrate a variety of simulated scenarios, utility functions, methods of play and commercially feasible embodiments e.g. boards, encasements, video-cartridges, hand-held computers and the like. Finally, a new and improved notation system is disclosed. All in all, the various aspects of the invention, together with the standardization of play at professional levels, should lead to the local and international re-vitalization of interest in Vectorial and Mancala-like games.","Classifications

System and method for managing security for a distributed healthcare application,US20010051879A1,"
A system and method for managing security for a distributed healthcare system, such as a system for placing laboratory orders and receiving test results. The network of healthcare businesses that use the system is referred to herein as a Health Data Network, or HDN. When the user log on to the system, the user connects to the system on behalf of a Health Data Network (HDN) Business. Through the user's user account, the user is linked with HDN Businesses. The user may be allowed to log on to the system on behalf of more than one HDN Business. If the user's practice has more than one location or business unit, and all orders and results are shared throughout the practice, the user's practice may be configured as a single HDN Business. In this case, the practice's data may be stored in a central location and can be accessed by all users who have the appropriate permissions. However, if the user's practice has more than one location or business unit, and the need exists to keep orders and results isolated within a location or business unit, the practice may be configured in a parent-child HDN Business relationship. In addition to the ability to log on to the system on behalf of an HDN Business, users also must have permission to actually use the many functions of the system, and need access to the data stored across the HDN. As part of creating the user's permission profile, the user is assigned a role that the user performs when working with the system. This includes information regarding the types of data the user needs to be able to access and the functions the user needs to carry out on that data. Types of data are referred to as objects and functions are referred to as operations. Patient records, lab requisitions, lab results, test codes, ICD-9 codes, lab profiles and physician profiles are examples of objects. An example of an operation is adding new objects. Viewing, modifying, printing, and deleting existing objects are also examples of operations. The process of searching for existing objects is also considered an operation. A role defines what objects a user can access and what operations a user is allowed to carry out on each of those objects.","Classifications

If there are errors in the information entered for the requisition, an error message may appear, and the user may be required to correct the errors. As part of performing this validation, the system may verify insurance information for the requisition, if applicable. In one embodiment, the system interfaces with a separate eligibility server to check for valid patient insurance. For example, the eligibility server may receive the patient name, social security number, and/or other identification information and use this information to check the patient's insurance status. If the patient does not have insurance coverage for the requested lab tests to be performed, the insurance information may be corrected, or other means for payment may be required. Once the requisition information has been validated, the information may be stored. The user may later use a menu option to select and electronically send the requisitions, e.g., by interfacing a middleware server which interfaces with the system for each laboratory which receives the requisitions. In another embodiment, the patient insurance information may be verified after being sent to the middleware server. The middleware server may interface with a separate eligibility server to verify the insurance information. If the insurance information is verified then the middleware server may transmit the requisition information to one or more laboratories specified in the requisition. Otherwise, the originating caregiver may be notified, and the requisition information may not be sent to the laboratories.","Classifications

Factor analysis of information risk,US20050066195A1,"
The invention is a method of measuring and representing security risk. The method comprises selecting at least one object within an environment and quantifying the strength of controls of at least one object within that environment. This is done by quantifying authentication controls, quantifying authorization controls, and then quantifying structural integrity. In the preferred method, the next step is setting global variables for the environment, for example, whether the environment is subject to regulatory laws, and then selecting at least one threat community, for example, professional hackers, and then calculating information risk. This calculation is accomplished by performing a statistical analysis using the strengths of controls of said at least one object, the characteristics of at least one threat community, and the global variables of the environment, to compute a value representing information risk. The method identifies the salient objects within a risk environment, defines their characteristics and how they interact with one another, utilizing a means of measuring the characteristics, and a statistically sound mathematical calculation to emulate these interactions and then derives probabilities. The method then represents the security risk, such as the risk to information security, such as by an integer, a distribution or some other means.","Classifications

Explicit representation of molecular shape of molecules is combined with neural network learning methods to provide models with high predictive ability that generalize to different chemical classes where structurally diverse molecules exhibiting similar surface characteristics are treated as similar. A new machine-learning methodology that can accept multiple representations of objects and construct models that predict characteristics of those objects. An extension of this methodology can be applied in cases where the representations of the objects are determined by a set of adjustable parameters. An iterative process applies intermediate models to generate new representations of the objects by adjusting said parameters and repeatedly retrains the models to obtain better predictive models.

Computer implemented machine learning and control system,US5946673A,"
In a computer implemented learning and/or process control system, a computer model is constituted by the most currently fit entity in a population of computer program entities. The computer model defines fitness as a function of inputs and outputs. A computing unit accesses the model with a set of inputs, and determines a set of outputs for which the fitness is highest. This associates a sensory-motor (input-output) state with a fitness in a manner that might be termed ""feeling"". The learning and/or control system preferably utilizes a compiling Genetic Programming system (CGPS) in which one or more machine code entities such as functions are created which represent solutions to a problem and are directly executable by a computer. The programs are created and altered by a program in a higher level language such as ""C"" which is not directly executable, but requires translation into executable machine code through compilation, interpretation, translation, etc. The entities are initially created as an integer array that can be altered by the program as data, and are executed by the program by recasting a pointer to the array as a function type. The entities are evaluated by executing them with training data as inputs, and calculating fitnesses based on a predetermined criterion. The entities are then altered based on their fitnesses using a genetic machine learning algorithm by recasting the pointer to the array as a data (e.g. integer) type. This process is iteratively repeated until an end criterion is reached.","Classifications

Data center activity traces form a corpus used for machine learning. The data in the corpus are putatively normal but may be tainted with latent anomalies. There is a statistical likelihood that the corpus represents predominately legitimate activity, and this likelihood is exploited to allow for a targeted examination of only the data representing possible anomalous activity. The corpus is separated into clusters having members with like features. The clusters having the fewest members are identified, as these clusters represent potential anomalous activities. These clusters are evaluated to determine whether they represent actual anomalous activities. The data from the clusters representing actual anomalous activities are excluded from the corpus. As a result, the machine learning is more effective and the trained system provides better performance, since latent anomalies are not mistaken for normal activity.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for performing extraction using machine learning,US6857112B1,"
A system for using machine-learning to create a model for performing integrated circuit layout extraction is disclosed. The system of the present invention has two main phases: model creation and model application. The model creation phase comprises creating one or more extraction models using machine-learning techniques. First, a complex extraction problem is decomposed into smaller simpler extraction problems. Then, each smaller extraction problem is then analyzed to identify a set of physical parameters that fully define the smaller extraction problem. Next, models are created using machine learning techniques for all of the smaller simpler extraction problems. The machine learning is performed by first creating training data sets composed of the identified parameters from typical examples of the smaller extraction problem and the answers to those example extraction problems as solved using a highly accurate physics-based field solver. The training sets are then used to train the models. In one embodiment, neural networks are used to model the extraction problems. Bayesian inference is employed by one embodiment in order to train the neural network models. Bayesian inference may be implemented with normal Monte Carlo techniques or Hybrid Monte Carlo techniques. After the creation of a set of models for each of the smaller simpler extraction problems, the machine-learning based models may be used for extraction.","Classifications

Semi-supervised random decision forests for machine learning using mahalanobis distance to identify geodesic paths,US9519868B2,"
Semi-supervised random decision forests for machine learning are described, for example, for interactive image segmentation, medical image analysis, and many other applications. In examples, a random decision forest comprising a plurality of hierarchical data structures is trained using both unlabeled and labeled observations. In examples, a training objective is used which seeks to cluster the observations based on the labels and similarity of the observations. In an example, a transducer assigns labels to the unlabeled observations on the basis of the clusters and certainty information. In an example, an inducer forms a generic clustering function by counting examples of class labels at leaves of the trees in the forest. In an example, an active learning module identifies regions in a feature space from which the observations are drawn using the clusters and certainty information; new observations from the identified regions are used to train the random decision forest.","Classifications

Application of category theory and cognitive science to design of semantic descriptions for content data,US7319951B2,"
Instead of focusing on specific, static semantic description schemes, emphasis and focus is placed on determining what is necessary and needed to create any type or kind of semantic description for content data in various applications such as MPEG-7. In particular, numerous semantic description tools are selected after examining the principles of cognitive science and category theory. These semantic description tools provide sufficient flexibility and power to create any type or kind of semantic description. Semantic entity tools and categorical structure tools were identified as necessary and needed to create any type or kind of semantic description. Semantic entity tools are tools that represent entities in a semantic description. Categorical structure tools are tools that represent categorical structures of semantic entities and relations among these categorical structures. The semantic entity tools and the categorical structure tools facilitate creation of a semantic mosaic description for content data from multiple semantic descriptions.","Classifications

Method of partitioning data records,US7272612B2,"
A tree-structured index to multidimensional data is created using occurring patterns and clusters within the data which permit efficient search and retrieval strategies in a database of DNA profiles. A search engine utilizes hierarchical decomposition of the database by identifying clusters of similar DNA profiles and maps to parallel computer architecture, allowing scale up past previously feasible limits. Key benefits of the new method are logarithmic scale up and parallelization. These benefits are achieved by identification and utilization of occurring patterns and clusters within stored data. The patterns and clusters enable the stored data to be partitioned into subsets of roughly equal size. The method can be applied recursively, resulting in a database tree that is balanced, meaning that all paths or branches through the tree have roughly the same length. The method achieves high performance by exploiting the natural structure of the data in a manner that maintains balanced trees. Implementation of the method maps to parallel computer architectures, allowing scale up to very large databases.","Classifications

System for estimating a distribution of message content categories in source data,US9189538B2,"
A method of computerized content analysis that gives “approximately unbiased and statistically consistent estimates” of a distribution of elements of structured, unstructured, and partially structured source data among a set of categories. In one embodiment, this is done by analyzing a distribution of small set of individually-classified elements in a plurality of categories and then using the information determined from the analysis to extrapolate a distribution in a larger population set. This extrapolation is performed without constraining the distribution of the unlabeled elements to be equal to the distribution of labeled elements, nor constraining a content distribution of content of elements in the labeled set (e.g., a distribution of words used by elements in the labeled set) to be equal to a content distribution of elements in the unlabeled set. Not being constrained in these ways allows the estimation techniques described herein to provide distinct advantages over conventional aggregation techniques.","Classifications

The Universal Automatic Instant Money, Data and Gold Transfer Machine, Uncle GEM II, system is a multiplicity of devices on a communications network available 24 hours a day, used interchangeably as sender, receiver and dispenser of funds and data. The sender accepts standard currency and includes removable medium storage devices to transfer to another such device acting as a receiver/dispenser. Remitted amounts are inserted or deducted from credit/debit accounts or currency and who pays the fees charged is indicated by an initiator of the transaction. Transfer transaction information includes: the type of transfer (money/funds or data); which device deducts the fee; how much money or what data to transfer; and to who and where the transfer transaction is to be made available. A receipt is generated by the sender via the system and a receiver becomes a dispenser when the recipient retrieves a pending transaction using the appropriate password or identification. The cash, data, or financial instrument is then dispensed. The Uncle GEMs also feature acceptance of alternate payment options, such as, precious metal coins, i.e., gold, silver and platinum, and precious stones, i.e. diamonds, sapphires, and rubies. In essence, virtually anything can be bought, purchased, bartered, traded or sold. Smartcards, phonecards and store specific cards can be used to buy goods and services, can be bought, or can be reloaded using the Uncle GEM II system.","Classifications

Method for constructing segmentation-based predictive models from data that is particularly well-suited for insurance risk or profitability modeling purposes,US7072841B1,"
The invention considers a widely applicable method of constructing segmentation-based predictive models from data that permits constraints to be placed on the statistical estimation errors that can be tolerated with respect to various aspects of the models that are constructed. The present invention uses these statistical constraints in a closed-loop fashion to guide the construction of potential segments so as to produce segments that satisfy the statistical constraints whenever it is feasible to do so. The method is closed-loop in a sense that the statistical constraints are used in a manner that is analogous to an error signal in a feed-back control system, wherein the error signal is used to regulate the inputs to the process that is being controlled.","Classifications

The unique features of the SDL language are the implicit constraints that are enforced on the relational data that belong to the objects. Unique to the SDL system is also the logical metadata of dimensions that enables the SDL system to enforce these constraints across relations. The SDL system utilizes several optimization techniques to enable efficient implementation on top of RDBMS. It is also shown how the SDL language and the SQL language can be merged with bidirectional inlining using syntactic gates. Query composition tools are also described that facilitate the creation of SDL expressions.","Classifications

Method for image data processing,US7756342B2,"
A method for exploiting the nonlinear structure of hyperspectral imagery employs a manifold coordinate system that preserves geodesic distances in the high-dimensional hyperspectral data space. Data representing physical parameters such as a scene is divided into a set of smaller tiles. The manifolds derived from the individual tiles are then aligned and stitched together to complete the scene. Coordinates are derived for a very large although not complete representative subset of the data termed the “backbone”. Manifold coordinates are derived for this representative backbone and then the remaining samples inserted into the backbone using a reconstruction principle using the property of local linearity everywhere on the manifold to reconstruct the manifold coordinates for the samples not originally belonging to the backbone. The output is a global manifold coordinate system, which for topographical image data depicts clearer detail of land and water portions of a scene.","Classifications

Data structures, systems, methods and computer program products that enable precise information retrieval and extraction, and thus facilitate relational and associative discovery are disclosed. The present invention utilizes a novel data structure termed a “Knowlet” which combines multiple attributes and values for relationships between concepts. While texts contain many re-iterations of factual statements, Knowlets record relationships between two concepts only once and the attributes and values of the relationships change based on multiple instances of factual statements, increasing co-occurrence or associations. The present invention's approach results in a minimal growth of the Knowlet space as compared to the text space and it thus useful where there is a vast data store, a relevant ontology/thesaurus, and a need for knowledge navigation and (relational, associative, and/or other) knowledge discovery.","Classifications

Techniques for determining orbital data,US4912475A,"
Techniques are disclosed for determining orbital data of space borne vehicles including earth satellites such as those of the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System. Each of a set of such satellites transmits signals which include carrier waves which may be suppressed, or only implicity present. The signals are received from the observable satellites concurrently by means of an antenna at each of at least three ground stations forming a network of baselines. The stations are arrayed such that the ratio of the maximum to the minimum baseline length is much greater than one. From the signals received at a station pair forming each baseline a time series of doubly-differenced phase measurement data is formed which is biased by an integer number of cycles of phase. The data series for different satellite and station pairs are processed together to determine the orbits of the satellites and the doubly-differenced phase biases. Unique determination of the integer values of at least some of the biases is facilitated by the above noted spatial arrangement of the stations such that the ratio of the maximum to the minimum baseline length is much greater than one. This integer bias determination enhances the accuracy of the related orbit determination.
Unique determination of the integer values of at least some of the doubly-differenced carrier phase biases may also be facilitated by the use of a plurality of carrier frequencies with the ratio of the maximum to the minimum frequency being much greater than one.","Classifications

A directed graph is created which depicts the identities of the ""derived"" GAPs, the ""defining"" GAPs from which derived GAPs can be interpolated, and the relationship between them. The GAPs reside at nodes on the graph which are interconnected with directed links that indicate the ""parent"" to ""child"" relationships, with each link representing an interpolation function which defines how the derived GAPs are interpolated from the defining GAPs. The graph and interpolation functions are conveyed to a decoder. Frames containing defining GAPs are then sent to the decoder, which performs the interpolations as directed by the graph and using the interpolation functions to reconstruct the derived GAPs.","Classifications

Multiplex cellular assays using detectable cell barcodes,US8003312B2,"
We describe herein a cell-based multiplexing technique called detectable cell barcoding (DCB). In DCB, each individual sample is labeled with a different DCB signature that distinguishes each sample by one or both of detected intensity or type of detection characteristic. The samples are then combined and analyzed for a detectable characteristic of interest (e.g., presence of an analyte). By employing multiple distinct DCB labels at varying concentrations, one can perform multiplex analyses on up to hundreds or thousands (or more) of cell samples in a single reaction tube. DCB reduces reagent consumption by factors of 100-fold or more, significantly reduces data acquisition times and allows for stringent control sample analysis.","Classifications

A natural language translation method and system translating medical reports created in natural language into structured data frames that can be utilized in computer databases for decision support, billing, research, and other purposes. Structured data entry is elicited from a patient in order to identify an appropriate disease signature corresponding to his or her condition and symptoms. In turn, the disease signature identifies the appropriate lexical domain with which to analyze the natural language report. The translation method and system use statistical analysis based on empirical data that particular combinations of words have interdepended previously within a modeled context and how frequently individual words interdepend generally and with what kinds of words. For each sentence in the report, the words in the medical report are looked up in the lexical domain individually and in combination with all other words coexisting in the same sentence. The word combinations are parsed to determine the likelihood the words interdepend in the report. For those words determined to interdepend, a semantic interpreter defines the semantic relationship between the words. A frame generator compiles the word relationships into records having fields recognized as pertinent by the disease signature and that can be searched and sorted by computers on those fields.","Classifications

Enhanced block ciphers with data-dependent rotations,US6269163B1,"
A plaintext message to be encrypted is segmented into a number of words, e.g., four words stored in registers A, B, C and D, and an integer multiplication function is applied to a subset of the words, e.g., to the two words in registers B and D. The integer multiplication function may be a quadratic function of the form ƒ(x)=x(ax+b) or other suitable function such as a higher-order polynomial. The results of the integer multiplication function are rotated by lg w bits, where lg denotes log base 2 and w is the number of bits in a given word, to generate a pair of intermediate results t and u. An exclusive-or of another word, e.g., the word in register A, and one of the intermediate results, e.g., t, is rotated by an amount determined by the other intermediate result u. Similarly, an exclusive-or of the remaining word in register D and the intermediate result u is rotated by an amount determined by the other intermediate result t. An element of a secret key array is applied to each of these rotation results, and the register contents are then transposed. This process is repeated for a designated number of rounds to generate a ciphertext message. Pre-whitening and post-whitening operations may be included to ensure that the input or output does not reveal any internal information about any encryption round. Corresponding decryption operations may be used to decrypt the ciphertext message.","Classifications

Data authentication using modification detection codes based on a public one way encryption function,US4908861A,"
A cryptographic method and apparatus are disclosed which transform a message or arbitrary length into a block of fixed length (128 bits) defined modification detection code (MDC). Although there are a large number of messages which result in the same MDC, because the MDC is a many-to-one function of the input, it is required that it is practically not feasible for an opponent to find them. In analyzing the methods, a distinction is made between two types of attacks, i.e., insiders (who have access to the system) and outsiders (who do not). The first method employs four encryption steps per DEA block and provides the higher degree of security. Coupling between the different DEA operations is provided by using the input keys also as data in two of the four encryption steps. In addition, there is cross coupling by interchanging half of the internal keys. Although this second coupling operation does not add to security in this scheme, it is mandatory in the second method, which employs only two encryption steps per DEA block to trade off security for performance. By providing key cross coupling in both schemes, an identical kernel is established for both methods. This has an implementation advantage since the first method can be achieved by applying the second method twice. The MDC, when loaded into a secure device, authorizes one and only one data set to be authenticated by the MDC, whereas methods based on message authentication codes or digital signatures involving a public key algorithm authorize a plurality of data sets to be authenticated. The MDC therefore provides for greater security control.","Classifications

Data distribution techniques for load-balanced fault-tolerant web access,US6070191A,"
A server system for processing client requests received over a communication network includes a cluster of N document servers and at least one redirection server. The redirection server receives a client request from the network and redirects it to one of the document servers, based on a set of pre-computed redirection probabilities. Each of the document servers may be an HTTP server that manages a set of documents locally and can service client requests only for the locally-available documents. A set of documents are distributed across the document servers in accordance with a load distribution algorithm which may utilize the access rates of the documents as a metric for distributing the documents across the servers and determining the redirection probabilities. The load distribution algorithm attempts to equalize the sum of the access rates of all the documents stored at a given document server across all of the document servers. In the event of a server failure, the redirection probabilities may be recomputed such that the load of client requests is approximately balanced among the remaining document servers. The redirection probabilities may also be recomputed periodically in order to take into account changes in document access rates and changes in server capacity. The recomputation may be based on a maximum-flow minimum-cost solution of a network flow problem.","Classifications

Soft error decoding of steganographic data,US7466840B2,"
Soft error decoding is used to decode steganographic messages embedded in image and audio signals. Content signals with auxiliary embedded data are analyzed to make determinations about changes made to the signals to embed the data. These determinations are weighted based on the confidence that they are correct and input to an error correcting process. In this manner, error correction of the auxiliary data takes advantage of soft error weighting to more effectively recover the steganographic message from content signals that undergo distortion and/or loss transformations after being embedded with steganographic data.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for compressing data produced from a well tool in a wellbore prior to transmitting the compressed data uphole to a surface apparatus,US5381092A,"
A wellbore apparatus adapted to be disposed in a wellbore is electrically connected to a surface apparatus disposed at a surface of the wellbore. When disposed in the wellbore, the wellbore apparatus receives a plurality of input signals from an earth formation traversed by the wellbore which are representative of characteristics of the earth formation. The wellbore apparatus includes a data compression apparatus which receives the input signals and compresses the input signals prior to transmission of the compressed input signals uphole to the surface apparatus. The data compression apparatus compresses the input signals by first subdividing the plurality of input signals into a plurality of groups, where the number of the plurality of groups is much less than the number of the plurality of input signals, and then generating one value for each group. Therefore, a plurality of values corresponding, respectively, to the plurality of groups represent the compressed input signals transmitted uphole to the surface apparatus. In addition, since the plurality of values is much less in number than the plurality of input signals, the telemetry requirements needed to transmit the plurality of values uphole, relative to the telemetry requirements needed to transmit the plurality of input signals uphole, is substantially reduced.","Classifications

Loop-filtering method for image data and apparatus therefor,US6665346B1,"
A loop-filtering method for reducing quantization effect generated when an image data is encoded and decoded, and an apparatus therefor. The loop-filtering method includes the steps of extracting a flag indicating whether the image data requires loop-filtering using the distribution of inverse quantized coefficients (IQCs) of an inverse quantized image data and a motion vector indicating the difference between the previous frame and the current frame. The image data corresponding to the flag is then filtered by a predetermined method if the extracted flag indicates a need for the loop-filtering. Using the flags and an adaptive filter reduces the quantization effect and is useful to reduce the amount of computation required for the filtering. Also, the filtering can be performed through parallel processing without multiplication and division, so that the complexity of hardware can be reduced.","Classifications

Synthesis of anomalous data to create artificial feature sets and use of same in computer network intrusion detection systems,US8527776B2,"
Detecting harmful or illegal intrusions into a computer network or into restricted portions of a computer network uses a process of synthesizing anomalous data to be used in training a neural network-based model for use in a computer network intrusion detection system. Anomalous data for artificially creating a set of features reflecting anomalous behavior for a particular activity is performed. This is done in conjunction with the creation of normal-behavior feature values. A distribution of users of normal feature values and an expected distribution of users of anomalous feature values are then defined in the form of histograms. The anomalous-feature histogram is then sampled to produce anomalous-behavior feature values. These values are then used to train a model having a neural network training algorithm where the model is used in the computer network intrusion detection system. The model is trained such that it can efficiently recognize anomalous behavior by users in a dynamic computing environment where user behavior can change frequently.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for displaying question and answer data on plural displays,US5842869A,"
An electronic device for displaying question data and answer data includes an input device for entering commands, first and second displays, and a processor. The question data is displayed on the first display which is visible to an operator of the electronic device and on a second display which is visible from a position from which the first display is not visible, i.e., the position of an observer such as a student. The operator can selectively control the displaying of the answer data on each of the displays using commands entered on the input device. Entry of a first command causes the answer data to be display only on the first display so that the answer is visible only to the operator. Entry of a second command causes the answer data to be displayed on the second display so that the observer can also see the answer. In one mode of operation, the question and answer data for many questions is stored in a storage device, and the questions are categorized by level of difficulty or by subject. The operator selects the category of questions to be presented, and the question and answer data for each question in the category is automatically retrieved from the storage device for display on the first and second displays. The operator enters commands through the input device to display each successive question and to selectively control the displaying of the answer to each question on the first and second displays.","Classifications

High energy X-ray inspection system for detecting nuclear weapons materials,US6347132B1,"
An x-ray inspection system for automatically detecting nuclear weapons materials generates a high energy x-ray fan beam or a traveling x-ray pencil beam that traverses an object under inspection. An x-ray detector detects x-ray energy that passes through the object and provides a detected signal indicative thereof. The detected signal is processed to detect the presence of an area of very high x-ray attenuation within the object under inspection, which is indicative of nuclear weapons materials. Because of the high atomic number (Z) and high density of nuclear weapons materials Uranium and Plutonium, both of these materials attenuate (i.e., absorb) incident x-rays significantly more than ordinary materials. That is, very high Z materials such as nuclear weapons materials, produce no x-rays outside of their block of material because the x-rays are self absorbed within the very high Z materials. Therefore, these materials can be detected by a transmission detectors, or by combining the readings from transmission and scatter detectors, if a pencil beam system is employed.","Classifications

These harmonic reproductions allow a user to immediately extract aspect information between the planet whose major line is harmonically reproduced and other planets, whether or not harmonically reproduced. The longitude and time axes preferably have a common origin at respective longitude and time coordinates corresponding to the vernal equinox, thus permitting sidereal and tropical time information to be extracted from the chart by simple linear scaling of coordinates. The chart is rendered especially useful for astronomers by the provision of a two-dimensional reproduction of the stars located within a band about the ecliptic. The information is color coded in order that the different major lines and their harmonics be readily identifiable.","Classifications

Content-based filtering of multicast information,US6055364A,"
The invention provides a method and system for content-based filtering of multicast information. A set of sources (S) which desire to distribute potentially large numbers of categories of differing information each associates a content descriptor (CD) with messages including information in those categories, so that a set of recipients (R) can receive information in at least some of those categories. A mapping server (M) associates a multicast address (MA) and a content mask (CM) with each content descriptor, so that network elements (N), such as routers, in the network can distribute only those messages which are of interest to recipients in multicast distribution trees for those multicast addresses. Each source generates content descriptors for each differentiable topic in a tree structured hierarchy, and obtains a multicast address and a content mask for the broadest content descriptor it is capable of distributing. Each recipient obtains the associated source, multicast address, and content mask, for each content descriptor of interest, and uses that information to join the multicast distribution tree for that information. Each network element between the source and the recipient determines what information it must forward for further distribution in response to the content descriptors, content masks, multicast addresses, and multicast distribution trees.","Classifications

The present invention provides an intuitive interface, referred to as a semantic user interface (SUI), that enhances the operation of the current standard window-based interface in a manner that is simple, richer and natural. By leveraging all of the richness and power inherent in a user's language, the present invention provides an important tool that allows the personal computer to operate in a manner that is much closer to our natural way of interacting. A user is allowed to enter ""commands"" in his everyday natural language in order to control the operations of the computer. All commands are language-based and user-defined. These commands can be entered from any context of the user's computer (e.g., any application or operating system workspace). The commands allows a user to launch applications and navigate within applications by using language rather than clicks from a pointing device such as a mouse. It also allows the replacement of keystrokes with stored words or keystrokes. The system also keeps a complete archive record of all the text content the user provides as input, regardless of which application program or operating system window the user is operating in at the time. The combined set of all user defined commands and the memory of all the input text that is stored in the archive constitutes the personality profile and is transportable from one computer to another.","Classifications

Collimator for x-ray spectroscopy,US5768339A,"
The invention claimed is a collimator for x-rays and the fabrication process for said collimator. The collimator, in its preferred embodiment, displays the general shape of a tube, having two apertures, an entrance aperture and an exit aperture. The walls of the collimator tube are not parallel to each other but rather are paraboloidal in longitudinal section. The geometry of the collimator tube is, therefore, circular in transverse cross-section and paraboloidal in longitudinal section, thereby resulting in a tube whose entrance aperture is of a smaller diameter than its exit aperture. The collimator geometry described is referred to herein as a tubular paraboloid. The preferred embodiment comprises a first tubular paraboloid, or first reflector, and a second tubular paraboloid, or second reflector, each having an outer surface and an ultrasmooth, reflecting inner surface, the second reflector being of smaller diameter than the first reflector and being held by suitable means in assembly concentrically with the first reflector, thereby defining an entrance aperture and an exit aperture. Alternate embodiments may employ more than two nested paraboloid reflectors and may also comprise a truncated cone reflector at the entrance aperture to provide a two reflection figure. In addition, the process developed is suitable for fabrication of optics with very small apertures and ultra smooth interior reflecting surfaces. Many types of reflecting surfaces may be produced, including gold, copper, nickel, palladium and others. The process is a replication method, so that once a master surface for an optic has been prepared, subsequent copies can be inexpensively reproduced. Thus, the fabrication process described is best suited for the production of many identical optics, rather than one-of-a-kind devices, and in a variety of unusual geometries in addition to tubular paraboloids.","Classifications

A backside illuminated charge coupled device (CCD) is formed of a relatively thick high resistivity photon sensitive silicon substrate, with frontside electronic circuitry, and an optically transparent backside ohmic contact for applying a backside voltage which is at least sufficient to substantially fully deplete the substrate. A greater bias voltage which overdepletes the substrate may also be applied. One way of applying the bias voltage to the substrate is by physically connecting the voltage source to the ohmic contact. An alternate way of applying the bias voltage to the substrate is to physically connect the voltage source to the frontside of the substrate, at a point outside the depletion region. Thus both frontside and backside contacts can be used for backside biasing to fully deplete the substrate. Also, high resistivity gaps around the CCD channels and electrically floating channel stop regions can be provided in the CCD array around the CCD channels.

Improved systems and methods for coded aperture imaging of radiation-emitting sources. According to one aspect, the present invention is directed to reducing and/or eliminating the artifacts that are inherent in previous near field coded aperture imaging systems such that the improved sensitivity and resolution of these systems can be practically utilized.
A system and method of the present invention utilizes two projections of radiation from an object, the first through a first coded aperture mask pattern, and the second through a second coded aperture mask pattern, where a decoding array associated with the second mask pattern is the negative of a decoding array associated with the first mask pattern. Data from both projections is combined to produce a reconstructed object image that is substantially free of near-field artifacts.

More particularly, the present invention relates to improvements in the design and fabrication of coded aperture masks for use in coded aperture imaging devices. Improvements can be made to the resolution, for instance, by selecting smaller pixel sizes for the opaque and transparent elements of the coded aperture mask. Also, it is possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for near-field applications by selecting an appropriate thickness for the mask. The signal-to-noise ratio may be further improved by selecting the appropriate mask pattern based on the particular characteristics of the near-field imaging problem at hand.","Classifications

Digital pixel-accurate intensity processing method for image information enhancement,US5592571A,"
An ""image information enhancement"" technique for processing digital images objectively extracts basic image information classes which are intensity defined and produced by the contrast mediums used for the generation of the image. The technique has wide application in the general field of image enhancement and more particularly in the fields of microscopy, radiology, remote sensing, astronomy, robotics and machine vision and general image evaluation, quantitation and communication. The new image intensity processing technology of this invention makes possible a separation of the image intensity information into three objective distinct non-random spacial groups of ""large image features/background"" and small ""spacial detail"" and ""intensity detail"", and one group of random spacial information of the ""image noise"". ""Detail enhancement"" allows a recovery of intensity-defined image components, eliminated by a pixel-accurate smoothing process, through subtraction of a smoothed image from another smoothed image or the original image. The overall contrast range of the recovered information is equal to the applied smoothing factor and can be automatically brought to the full visual intensity range by linear contrast stretching. This has the advantage of maintaining detail contrast proportions which closely reflect the raw data characteristics. If high pixel accuracy processing is provided, ""detail slicing"" becomes possible. Two smoothed images, each processed with a different smoothing factor, can be subtracted providing the information difference between least smoothed and the most smoothed data set.","Classifications

Low-resistivity photon-transparent window attached to photo-sensitive silicon detector,US6025585A,"
The invention comprises a combination of a low resistivity, or electrically conducting, silicon layer that is transparent to long or short wavelength photons and is attached to the backside of a photon-sensitive layer of silicon, such as a silicon wafer or chip. The window is applied to photon sensitive silicon devices such as photodiodes, charge-coupled devices, active pixel sensors, low-energy x-ray sensors and other radiation detectors. The silicon window is applied to the back side of a photosensitive silicon wafer or chip so that photons can illuminate the device from the backside without interference from the circuit printed on the frontside. A voltage sufficient to fully deplete the high-resistivity photosensitive silicon volume of charge carriers is applied between the low-resistivity back window and the front, patterned, side of the device. This allows photon-induced charge created at the backside to reach the front side of the device and to be processed by any circuitry attached to the front side. Using the inventive combination, the photon sensitive silicon layer does not need to be thinned beyond standard fabrication methods in order to achieve full charge-depletion in the silicon volume. In one embodiment, the inventive backside window is applied to high resistivity silicon to allow backside illumination while maintaining charge isolation in CCD pixels.","Classifications

The Lobster Eye X-ray Imaging System collects (focuses) thousands of times more backscattered hard X-rays in the range from 40 to 120 keV (or wavelength λ=0.31 to 0.1 Å) than current backscatter imaging sensors (BISs), giving high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and penetration through ground, metal walls etc. The collection efficiency of Lobster Eye X-ray Imaging System is optimized to reduce emitted X-ray power and miniaturize the device. This device is especially advantageous for and satisfies requirements of X-ray-based inspection systems, namely, penetration of the X-rays through ground, metal and other material concealments; safety; and man-portability. The advanced technology disclosed herein is also applicable to medical diagnostics and military applications such as mine detection, security screening and a like.","Classifications

Near field imaging using a THz imaging system is realized by utilizing an interferometric imaging detector array that includes detector elements disposed on a surface curved, physically or artificially, to match substantially the curvature of the wave front for received THz signals. Generally, the near field is an environment wherein the distance to an object of interest is on the order of 10–100 times larger than the physical size of the THz imaging array. Typical distances from the object or target to the imaging array is anticipated to be in the 0.5 m–50 m range. Curvature of the detector array corrects a distortion problem in prior THz imaging systems that utilized planar interferometric imaging arrays based on a planar wave front assumption for received THz signals.","Classifications

At least two directional transducers are coupled to the surface of the body at different locations about the body in such a manner that their directional receiving patterns intersect. These transducers may be acoustic or electromagnetic transducers, but in any case are capable of receiving thermally-generated energy from inside the body and generating corresponding electrical signals. The intersection of the receiving patterns of the transducers defines a common volume which is relatively small, and the signals at each transducer originating from this common volume within the body exhibit a high degree of correlation. A multiplier receives the electrical signals produced by the transducers. A fixed or variable delay is interposed between at least one of the transducers and the multiplier. A low pass filter or integrator is connected to average the product output signal from the multiplier and thereby generate a correlation output signal which is a measure of the thermally-generated energy within the common volume of intersection of the directional receiving patterns of the transducers.","Classifications

A method and apparatus are provided for imaging and identifying concealed objects within an obscuring medium using radiation (optical, photo-acoustic, ionizing, and/or acoustic) optimized for imaging (e.g. temporal properties, spectral bandwidth, directionality, polarization, etc.). Radiation propagates through, interacts with, exits the medium and the object, and is detected/imaged. Image quality can be improved if radiation is collimated and/or if transmission and/or backscattered measurements from a number of perspectives are used to improved image reconstruction. Coupling materials can be employed during image acquisition to enhance radiation coupling as well as providing desirable absorption and scattering properties. Contrast materials and agents can also aid in the detection of concealed objects. Adaptive methods, e.g. using reference objects, including implementations based on the concept of guide stars, can improve the imaging process. The surface can be monitored and groomed to enhance the imaging process. Tomosynthesis techniques can be used to reconstruct images. Acousto-optic effects may be observed when both optical radiation and acoustic radiation are introduce into the medium. A laser vibrometry, speckle, or holographic interferometry imaging technique can be used to readout the acoustic waveform exiting the medium surface directly or after interacting with a deformable mirrored or reflective layer coupled to the medium. The medium may be prepared prior to imaging in order to reduce surface irregularities and roughness. Multilayer mirrors and capillary optics can be used to enhance imaging systems which use ionizing radiation. Resistance images can be obtained using probes to penetrate the medium.","Classifications

Apparatus and method for producing three-dimensional images,US5394151A,"
An apparatus and method is capable of acquiring useful three-dimensional ar images from an aircraft which travels in a curvilinear path to generate only a sparsely filled synthetic array. A motion measurement unit outputs position measurements as the aircraft travels in the curvilinear path. The system includes a motion compensation and timing unit and a wave transmitter which outputs chirped radar signals. An antenna coupled to the wave generator sends the chirped radar signals to a region to be imaged and receives scattered chirped radar return signals from scatterers in the region. These scattered signals are coherently mixed to baseband and digitized before being input to a processor. The processor includes a range processing unit, a memory unit and an estimator. The range processor receives and Fourier transforms the digitized return signals to obtain range profiles. The estimator completes the image formation process by three-dimensional back projection of the range profiles. It also estimates the location and complex strengths of scatterers and uses these to generate a side lobe free image.","Classifications

A coded aperture is placed in proximity of a patient's body and a 2D coded image is acquired in conventional manner. The basic data-acquisition geometry is similar to that used in various coded-aperture systems. According to one aspect of the invention, additional coded images are acquired with different spacings between the aperture and the detector. Alternatively, additional coded images could be acquired with multiple movable apertures or by varying the location of the aperture relative to a patient. Another aspect of the invention resides in the recognition that presently available computer algorithms can process these multiple coded images in such a way as to estimate the integrals of the 3D object over a set of parallel cylindrical tubes extending through the volume of the target object. Such “tube integrals” can be thought of as the output of an ideal collimator where the sensitivity is confined to a tubular region of constant cross-section.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for the correction of optical signal wave front distortion within a free-space optical communication system,US20030001073A1,"
A free space optical communication system is disclosed whereby the optics of a receive telescope are manipulated using adaptive optics to compensate for wave front distortion of a light beam transmitted by a transmit telescope. Wave front distortion is manifested at the receive telescope as a deviation from the normal, orthogonal orientation of the wave front of the transmitted light beam relative to its line of travel. This deviation may be detected, for example, by a wave front sensor, such as a Shack-Hartman sensor, which identifies the slope, or beam tilt, of discrete sections of the transmitted beam. The optics of the receive telescope can then be deformed in such a way as to cancel the wave front distortion and correspondingly reduce the resulting distortion of the received signal.","Classifications

The antennae may be radially directed toward a point within or on the surface of a human body for comparison with known temperature distribution data for that point and a given ambient temperature. Each frequency band may provide a plurality of adjacent noise measuring channels for measuring microwave noise naturally emitted by the human body. The apparatus measures short-term changes in, for example, core and body surface temperatures to establish a basal metabolic rate. Changes in core body temperature may be stimulated by the administration of food or certain organic and drug-related substances or stress to induce a change in basal metabolic rate over time. These changes correlate directly with a human subject's metabolism rate at rest and under certain dietary constraints and can be used to determine courses of treatment for obesity, metabolic disease, and other disorders. The apparatus can also be used to remotely monitor patients and subjects without physical contact.","Classifications

"Bi-directional, fast-timing, charge coupled device",US5693968A,"
A fast-timing bi-directional charge coupled device (""CCD"") is disclosed. The CCD operates at a much faster overall rate than conventional CCD's, while paradoxically slowing down the readout rate of the pixels. Lower power consumption is required, less heat is generated, thermal noise is lower, and digital noise is lower. The novel CCD is capable of 10-25 μsec timing resolution (or even faster). The configuration entirely eliminates the (formerly) rate-determining step of transferring data ""horizontally"" from the ""top"" of the CCD columns. Instead, the charges on columns are transferred either ""up"" or ""down"" in an alternating manner. For example, the charges in odd-numbered columns might be transferred one row ""up"" with each clock cycle, and charges in even-numbered columns might be transferred ""down."" This alternating charge transfer architecture is termed ""bi-directional."" There is no ""horizontal"" transfer of data off the chip; rather, each column outputs to a separate amplifier, preferably located on-chip. There is no need for a shutter in a low flux setting, although a shutter could be used for a high flux application. Without a shutter, the readout from each column is continual, without interruption; i.e., there is no ""dead time"" when light is not being detected. Assuming that light impinges on adjacent pixels in at least two different columns, the position and time of incoming light is reconstructed from the readouts of adjacent columns. The position of the impinging light is determined as the midpoint of readouts from adjacent columns; and the time of light arrival is proportional to the difference in readout from the adjacent columns. Unlike a conventional CCD, in a fast-timing, bi-directional CCD the clock time equals the time resolution of the overall image. Thus a relatively slow clock time of 10 μsec provides a very fast image time resolution of 10 μsec. In comparison to the 30 msec time resolution that is characteristic of conventional CCD's, the fast-timing bi-directional CCD can have a time resolution at least three orders of magnitude faster. The need for fast horizontal clocking is eliminated, as is the need for cooling. The fastest existing conventional CCD's can have a readout rate of about 106 pixels per second. The novel fast-timing CCD's can have a readout rate of 107 pixels per second, or even higher. Although the readout architecture of the novel fast-timing bi-directional CCD's is new, no new fabrication technologies are needed to construct the novel CCD's.","Classifications

"Method for correcting optical wavefront errors and optical system, such as a telescope, produced accordingly",US6426834B1,"
In a method for correcting optical wavefront errors in an optical system, the optical wavefront is calculated for different wavelengths and fields of view between the entry pupil (EP) and exit pupil (AP). Any phase differences are compensated by at least one surface (5, 7) compensating the phase differences in the beam path. A particular optical system, expediently in the form of a telescope, accordingly has a beam path which comprises the following: a first reflector (3), arranged along its axis (A), for reflecting a beam (1) incident along an optical axis (O) onto a concave second reflector (4) which throws the beam obtained from the first reflector (3) onto a third reflector (5), from which it is passed to a concave fourth reflector (6) in order to be reflected at an angle with said optical axis (O). Such a means (5, 7) for correcting the wavefront errors is provided in the beam path of such an optical system. The axis (A) of the first reflector (3) can optionally make an angle (α) of 0° with the optical axis (O); the means (5, 7) permits the correction of asymmetry errors resulting from the angular position.","Classifications

Method of fabrication free-standing thin films of polyimide,US5261977A,"
A method of fabricating free-standing thin films of polyimide by casting a polyamic acid solution onto a substrate that is free of parting agents and release agents is disclosed. The polyamic acid film is imidized on the substrate. The thickness of the polyimide film can range from about 200 Å to about five microns. A frame is adhered to the polyimide film while the film still attached to the substrate, and the frame, film, and substrate assembly is immersed in an aqueous based liquid bath for several hours wherein the liquid bath is free of reactive chemical agents. The liquid bath is heated, preferably, to a temperature within the range 30° to 100° C. The liquid is prevented from contacting the polyimide film within the interior region of the frame. Next, the assembly is removed from the water bath. The film is scored around the outside edge of the frame with a cutting tool; this cutting step may be performed either prior to, during, or after the immersion step. The frame is then detached from the substrate by first lifting only one side of the frame and then pivoting on the edge 180 degrees opposite. The process uses the frame itself to peel the film off the substrate, thereby producing a frame-supported and free-standing polyimide film. The present method omits the use of chemical agents, release agents, parting agents, and other detachment means whose purpose would have been to loosen the bond between the film and the substrate. The polyimide film may be metallized by vacuum evaporation or by sputtering to create a metal-polyimide composite. Free-standing thin polyimide films find particular utility in x-ray optics as bandpass filters and proportional counter entrance windows.","Classifications

Solid state photomultiplier,US4586068A,"
A solid state photon detector includes a semiconducting blocking layer with sufficiently low donor and acceptor concentrations that substantially no charge transport can occur by an impurity conduction mechanism. A semiconducting buffered layer is provided with a sufficiently high donor impurity concentration to create an impurity energy band and with a sufficiently high acceptor impurity concentration that an electron cannot be injected into and drift through the layer without recombining with ionized donors. A semiconducting active layer is positioned between the blocking and buffered layers with a sufficiently high donor concentration to create an impurity energy band. The acitve layer also includes a sufficiently low acceptor impurity concentration that a photogenerated electron can drift through the active layer without recombining with ionized donors. A first electrical contact with the blocking layer collects electrons without injecting D+ charge carriers, while a second electrical contact with the buffered layer collects carriers from the impurity band. The detector is designed to operate with a sufficient electrical bias applied between the first and second contacts to raise the field at some point in the active layer to the threshold for impact ionization of donor impurities. Under appropriate conditions, such detectors are capable of detecting single photons.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for using a color table scheme for displaying information on either color or monochrome display,US7714875B2,"
A method and system of determining the screen capability and rendering the appropriate display attribute is herein described. The present invention performs this task by using a color table, which contains a list of object types and a corresponding list of display attributes. The application program obtains the correct display attribute for the object by calling the color table, giving it an identifier of the object. The color table is indexed by the identifier of the object and a screen capability flag that is obtained, in one embodiment, from the operating system. The color table provides the display attribute for the specified object based on the screen capability flag. Advantageously, the application program does not need to know the computer's display capability. Furthermore, the application program needs only one piece of computer code, regardless of the number of display capabilities which are possible. Thus, memory space in the palmtop is conserved. In another embodiment of the present invention, the application program is allowed to modify the default values of the display attributes in the color table. Thus, an application program could use its own color to display an object if the default color is undesirable.","Classifications

Digital tracking platform for telescopes,US7982951B1,"
A digitally controlled platform for precise celestial tracking of astronomical telescopes, generally those having an independent pointing mechanism. A movable stage carrying the telescope is moved relative to a base by three digitally controlled actuators each of which determines the distance between a point fixed in the base and a point fixed stage. The base and stage otherwise are connected by a mechanism that holds a single point fixed in the base in coincidence with a single point fixed in the stage. It functions without approximation at any digitally specified latitude and longitude, enabling astrophotography with alt/azimuth mounted telescopes and diurnal tracking through the zenith. The digital controller may be a personal computer laptop running a multitasking operating system linked to the platform electronics by a Universal Serial Bus cable. Novel software design allows precise tracking, control, and calibration in spite of operating system and Universal Serial Bus latency.","Classifications

Passive microwave assessment of human body core to surface temperature gradients and basal metabolic rate,US8013745B2,"
A passive microwave thermography apparatus uses passive microwave antennas designed for operation, for example, at WARC protected frequencies of 1.400 to 1.427 GHz and 2.690 to 2.70 GHz (for core body gradient temperature measurement) and 10.68 to 10.700 GHz or higher microwave frequency (for surface body gradient temperature measurement) and a related directional antenna or antenna array to measure microwave radiation emanating from an animal, especially, a human body. The antennae may be radially directed toward a point within or on the surface of a human body for comparison with known temperature distribution data for that point and a given ambient temperature. Each frequency band may provide a plurality of adjacent noise measuring channels for measuring microwave noise naturally emitted by the human body. The apparatus measures short-term changes in, for example, core and body surface temperatures to establish a basal metabolic rate. Changes in core body temperature may be stimulated by the administration of food or certain organic and drug-related substances or stress to induce a change in basal metabolic rate over time. These changes correlate directly with a human subject's metabolism rate at rest and under certain dietary constraints and can be used to determine courses of treatment for obesity, metabolic disease, and other disorders. The apparatus can also be used to remotely monitor patients and subjects without physical contact.","Classifications

An instrument is provided which requires no complex computations or high degree of skill in aligning scales to accurately indicate the time of day from observations of the position of the sun, and to accurately locate the moon, the sun, and other stars and constellations in celestial space.
The instrument comprises a vertically adjustable stand upon which is mounted a support plane which may be rotated about a horizontal axis to accommodate alignment with the celestial equator. To the support plate is mounted a single rotary disk rotatable about a principal axis normal to the plane of the support plate. Inscribed upon the surface of the disk are an hour scale, a month-day scale, a right ascension hour angle scale, a local hour angle scale, a moon phase scale, a lunation scale to trace the phases of the moon, and a zodiac constellation display.
Integrally formed from and normal to the disk are a sunbeam aperture plate, a sunbeam trace plate, and a plate having a declination scale inscribed thereon and to which a space object pointer with a bubble level is rotatably attached. Inscribed on the surface of the sunbeam trace plate opposite the aperture plate are time equation graphs tracing the movement of the sun in both the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. Sun declination scales and mean sun base lines corresponding to each time graph are also inscribed on the trace plate.
When the support plate is aligned with its face toward the north and parallel to the plane of the celestial equator, the rotary disk may be turned to a position where sunlight passes through an aperture of the sunbeam aperture plate to strike a time equation graph or a mean sun base line inscribed on the trace plate. A rotary meridian marker mounted to the support plate so as to rotate about its principal axis independent of the rotary disk may then be used to directly indicate standard time, daylight saving time, solar time, or mean solar time on the hour scale.
To function as a space transit, the rotary disk may be adjusted for longitudinal correction and right ascension, and the space object pointer may be adjusted for declination to locate the moon, sun, planets and other stars and constellations in space. Conversely, after the instrument has been directed toward an object in space, the instrument may be adjusted to indicate the right ascension and declination of the object. In addition, the constellations of the zodiac may be more generally located by means of the zodiac constellation display and a knowledge of the sun's declination during the month of concern.
The moon phase and lunation interval scales make possible the tracing of any moon phase throughout the current and subsequent years. Further, when the date of the moon phase is determined, the right ascension and hour angle of the moon at any given time during the phase may be acquired.","Classifications

High resolution telescope including an array of elemental telescopes aligned along a common axis and supported on a space frame with a pivot at its geometric center,US5108168A,"
A large effective-aperture, low-cost optical telescope with diffraction-limited resolution enables ground-based observation of near-earth space objects. The telescope has a non-redundant, thinned-aperture array in a center-mount, single-structure space frame. It employes speckle interferometric imaging to achieve diffraction-limited resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio problem is mitigated by moving the wavelength of operation to the near-IR, and the image is sensed by a Silicon CCD. The steerable, single-structure array presents a constant pupil. The center-mount, radar-like mount enables low-earth orbit space objects to be tracked as well as increases stiffness of the space frame. In the preferred embodiment, the array has elemental telescopes with subaperture of 2.1 m in a circle-of-nine configuration. The telescope array has an effective aperture of 12 m which provides a diffraction-limited resolution of 0.02 arc seconds. Pathlength matching of the telescope array is maintained by a electro-optical system employing laser metrology. Speckle imaging relaxes pathlength matching tolerance by one order of magnitude as compared to phased arrays. Many features of the telescope contribute to substantial reduction in costs. These include eliminating the conventional protective dome and reducing on-site construction activities. The cost of the telescope scales with the first power of the aperture rather than its third power as in conventional telescopes.","Classifications

Large-vocabulary speech recognition using an integrated syntactic and semantic statistical language model,US5839106A,"
Methods and apparatus for performing large-vocabulary speech recognition employing an integrated syntactic and semantic statistical language model. In an exemplary embodiment, a stochastic language model is developed using a hybrid paradigm in which latent semantic analysis is combined with, and subordinated to, a conventional n-gram paradigm. The hybrid paradigm provides an estimate of the likelihood that a particular word, chosen from an underlying vocabulary will occur given a prevailing contextual history. The estimate is computed as a conditional probability that a word will occur given an ""integrated"" history combining an n-word, syntactic-type history with a semantic-type history based on a much larger contextual framework. Thus, the exemplary embodiment seamlessly blends local language structures with global usage patterns to provide, in a single language model, the proficiency of a short-horizon, syntactic model with the large-span effectiveness of semantic analysis.","Classifications

Determining a natural language shift in a computer document,US5913185A,"
Language shift points in a computer document written in a plurality of natural languages are determined. An interval is defined on and moved through a text document in a computer memory, the interval contains a portion of the text in the document. As the interval is moved through the document for each position of the interval, a probability that the text in the interval is written in each of a plurality of candidate languages is determined for the position. For the first position of the interval, generally the beginning of the document, a first candidate language is classified as the current language if it has the highest probability of all the candidate languages within the interval. A language shift point in the document is identified where the relative probability of a second candidate language is higher than the current language at a new position of the interval. At this point, the second candidate language is classified as the current language in the document after the language shift point. The process continues to identify other language shift points in the document.","Classifications

System and method for identifying language using morphologically-based techniques,US6415250B1,"
A language identification system for automatically identifying a language in which an input text is written based upon a probabilistic analysis of predetermined portions of words sampled from the input text. The predetermined portions of words reflect morphological characteristics of natural languages. The automatic language identification system determines which language of a plurality of represented languages a given text is written based upon a value representing the relative likelihood that the text is a particular one of the plurality of represented languages due to a presence of a morphologically-significant word portion in the text. Preferably the word portion is the last three characters in a word. The relative likelihood is derived from a relative frequency of occurrence of the fixed-length word ending in each of a plurality of language corpuses, within each language corpus corresponding to one of the plurality of represented languages. Specifically, the automatic language identification system includes a language corpus analyzer that generates, for each of a plurality of word endings extracted from at least one of the language corpuses, a plurality of probabilities associated with the word ending and one of the plurality of represented languages. Each of the language corpuses represents a natural language and each of the probabilities represents a relative likelihood that the text is the associated language due to the presence of the associated word ending in the text. The relative likelihood is derived from a relative frequency that the associated word ending occurs in each of the plurality of language corpuses. The automatic language identification system also comprises a language identification engine that determines, for each of the represented languages, an arithmetic sum of the relative probabilities for all the word endings which appear in the text. The source language is determined to be the represented language having the greatest arithmetic sum of relative probabilities, provided this sum exceeds zero.","Classifications

Dynamic language model for speech recognition,US5384892A,"
A method of speech recognition which determines acoustic features in a sound sample; recognizes words comprising the acoustic features based on a language model, which determines the possible sequences of words that may be recognized; and the selection of an appropriate response based on the words recognized. Information about what words may be recognized, under which conditions those words may be recognized, and what response is appropriate when the words are recognized, is stored, in a preferred embodiment, in a data structure called a speech rule. These speech rules are partitioned according to the context in which they are active. When speech is detected, concurrent with acoustic feature extraction, the current state of the computer system is used to determine which rules are active and how they are to be combined in order to generate a language model for word recognition. A language model is dynamically generated and used to find the best interpretation of the acoustic features as a word sequence. This word sequence is then matched against active rules in order to determine the appropriate response. Rules that match all or part of the word sequence contribute data structures representing the ""meaning"" of the word sequence, and these data structures are used by the rule actions in order to generate an appropriate response to the spoken utterance.","Classifications

Natural language understanding system,US5794050A,"
The present invention interprets natural language input using common sense reasoning. The invention avoids the combinatorial explosion that has occurred in other natural language understanding systems. The invention uses modules for parsing, disambiguation, formal semantics, anaphora resolution, and coherence, and a naive semantic lexicon. The naive semantic lexicon is consulted by the parsing, disambiguation, formal semantics, anaphora resolution, and coherence modules to determine whether an interpretation alternative is plausible based on the world knowledge contained in the naive semantic lexicon. The parsing module employs both a top-down and bottom-up parsing strategy. The parsing module consults the naive semantic lexicon to build a structure from natural language input that has both semantic and pragmatic plausibility. The invention uses a psychologically-motivated naive semantic ontology that provides a means for classifying concepts. The lexicon relates word senses to the ontological concepts, contains word sense-specific common sense knowledge, and connects syntactic information with the meaning of each word sense. Using the natural language understanding of the present invention, a process is used for retrieving text that includes the steps of: 1) natural language understanding of a document base, 2) natural language understanding of a text retrieval request (i.e., query), 3) a comparison of the output of steps 1 and 2.","Classifications

"Natural language analyzing apparatus and method, and construction of a knowledge base for natural language analysis",US5424947A,"
A system for resolving structural ambiguities in syntactic analysis of natural language, which ambiguities are caused by prepositional phrase attachment, relative clause attachment, and other modifier-modifiee relationships in sentences. The system uses instances of dependency (modification relationship) structures extracted from a terminology dictionary as a knowledge base. Structural ambiguity is represented by indicating that a word in a sentence has several words as candidate modifiees. The system resolves such ambiguity by 1) first searching the knowledge base, which contains dependency information in the form of tree structures, for dependencies between the word and each of its possible modifiees, 2) then assigning an order of preference to these dependencies by means of a path search in the tree structures, and 3) finally selecting the most preferable dependency as the modifiee. The sentences can be analyzed by a parser and transformed into dependency structures by the system. The knowledge base can be constructed automatically, since the source of knowledge exists in the form of texts, and knowledge bootstrapping can be realized by adding the outputs of the system to its knowledge base.","Classifications

System and method for identifying the language of written text having a plurality of different length n-gram profiles,US6272456B1,"
A window of letters is identified within a text sample input. If the window contains matches to reference letter sequences (RLS) contained in multiple sets of n-gram language profiles (profiles), then the longest match is kept and scored for each language. Scoring each language is based on frequency parameters of the matched RLS in profiles for each language. The window is incrementally shifted through the sample and the matching and scoring is done on the letters within the window. At the end of the sample input, the language having the highest cumulative score is identified as the sample's language. Scoring may be improved by restricting the RLS within longer profiles to be full words, using two passes where the second pass disregards languages that are not scored near the highest scoring language during the first pass, favoring matched RLS within profiles of complete words during scoring, favoring longer matched RLS within profiles during scoring, and increasing a score of a match that does not frequently appear in many languages. The profiles may be enhanced by removing some of the RLS if the frequency of the RLS does not meet a predefined threshold and a variable threshold.","Classifications

"Method, system and computer program product for dynamic language switching via messaging",US6469713B2,"
Language, locale, and display change system messages are defined which contain language or locale codes for changing a display language in a user interface. An operating system language or locale property may be altered, or merely the language and/or locale property of a user interface for a specific application or dialog. When received, all subscribers registered as listeners for such language, locale, and display change system messages are notified. The system message may originate from a control dialog or from another application, and may be passed from one application to another or to dialogs associated with the receiving application. User interface dialogs or applications notified of the system message may reload the contents of displays, updating the user interface display to contain the contents of menu labels, help text, or dialog messages in the new human language or display text formatted in accordance with the new cultural convention. The system message thus permits a run-time change of the display language employed for a user interface. This in turn enables remote support by users employing different languages, setting user interface display languages based on user preference, and temporary transactional language switching.","Classifications

Image or graphic elements such as pictures, icons and clip art, are intercepted during transfer from a computer source to a computer destination, such as during a cut-and-paste operation. Embedded text within the intercepted element is optically recognized, and encoded text is extracted. It is determined if the language of the text matches a desired language of the destination. If not, a translation of the optically-recognized text data is performed, and the translated text data is rendered into image data. The image data is then substituted into the intercepted element to overlay or replace the original embedded text, thereby “translating” the image or graphic element to a desired destination language. The modified image or graphic element is then delivered to the destination, such as a document, program, file or data structure.","Classifications

Automatic language identification/verification system,US5689616A,"
A language identification and verification system is described whereby language identification is determined by finding the closest match of a speech utterance to multiple speaker sets. The language identification and verification system is implemented through use of a speaker identification/verification system as a baseline to find a set of well matched speakers in each of a plurality of languages. A comparison of unknown speech to speech features from such well-matched speakers is then made and a language decision is arrived on based on a closest match between the unknown speech features and speech features for such well matched reference speakers in a particular language. To avoid a problem associated with prior-art language identification systems, wherein speech feature are based on short-term spectral features determined at a system frame rate--thereby seriously limiting the resolution and accuracy of such prior-art systems, the invention uses speech features derived from vocalic or syllabic nuclei, from which related phonetic speech features may then be extracted. Detection of such vocalic centers or syllabic nuclei is accomplished using a trained back-error propagation multi-level neural network.","Classifications

A natural language (NL) analyzing system is provided with the capability to analyze NL expressions and to resolve ambiguities and present them to the user for verification of correct interpretation. A conceptual model of the system, relevant to the application in which the invention is implemented, is created (customizing the system) by the user, and is stored as a conceptual schema. The schema is built of logical facts representing entities (concepts) and relationships between entities, forming a description of the universe of discourse or object system in question. The entities of the schema have at least one external connection, namely to natural language terms in a vocabulary. The schema itself is completely language independent, though the components of it may have ""names"" expressed in a natural language such as English. There may be a second connection to the entities, namely where the system is used in a query system for relational data bases. In this case the entities of the schema represent objects in the data base, and thus there is a connection between the entities and those objects of the data base. The actual analysis of NL expressions is performed by a natural language engine (NLE) in cooperation with an analysis grammar and the schema. The analysis results in an intermediate, language-independent logic form representation of the input, which is paraphrased back to NL for verification. If the input is a query, there is a translation into a query language such as SQL.","Classifications

A method and apparatus for computer translation between a natural language, such as English, and a second language, such as the command language of a computer operating system, a job control language, a robot control language, a numerical control machine program language or subset of another natural language.
The system for an operating system interface performs semantic processing of natural language requests by applying cryptographic techniques and indexes to guide an Artificial Intelligence search and inference mechanism in a mapping process from the user request to the target command set. Other cryptographic characteristics such as frequency distribution of classes of words and letters are used to allocate and retrieve the information in the knowledge base. The system also utilizes a high speed cryptographic filter to reduce computational overhead. A crypto-signature is computed in this filtering process to permit fast and efficient pattern matching access and to interface the virtual memory system. Interpretation of requests having insufficient information or ambiguities is achieved by the use of information theory concepts of entropy and key equivocation in conjunction with a conversational mode.
The system also rewrites the knowledge provided by the user in a form of Extended-Microinstructions, that participate in the inductive mapping process and code generation for the desired secondary language. The Extended-Microinstructions define the structure, parameters, and order of execution of a series of general purpose procedures used in the mapping process of the natural language to the command set.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for language translation,US6233544B1,"
Methods and systems for language translation are disclosed. The translator is based on finite state machines that can convert a pair of input symbol sequences to a pair of output symbol sequences. The translator includes a lexicon associating a finite state machine with a pair of head words with corresponding meanings in the source and target languages. The state machine for a source language head word w and a target language head word ν reads the dependent words of w to its left and right in a source sentence and proposes corresponding dependents to the left and right of ν in a target language sentence being constructed, taking account of the required word order for the target language. The state machines are used by a transduction search engine to generate a plurality of candidate translations via a recursive process wherein, a source language head word is first translated as described above, and then the heads of each of the dependent phrases are similarly translated, and then their dependents and so on. Only the state machines corresponding to the words in the source language string are activated and used by the search engine. The translator also includes a parameter table that provides costs for actions taken by each finite state machine in converting between the source language and the target language. The costs for machine transitions are indicative of the likelihood of co-occurence of pairs of words in the source language, and between corresponding pairs of words in the target language. The transduction search engine provides a total cost, using the parameter table, for each of the candidate translations. The total cost of a translation is the sum of the cost for all actions taken by each machine involved in the translation.","Classifications

Computer-aided writing system and method with cross-language writing wizard,US7107204B1,"
A computer-aided writing system offers assistance to a user writing in a non-native language, as the user needs help, without requiring the user to divert attention away from the entry task. The writing system provides a user interface (UI) that integrates writing assistance with in-line text entry. When the user is unsure of a word's spelling or whether the word is appropriate, the user may enter a corresponding native word directly in line with the ongoing sentence. An error tolerant spelling tool accepts the native word (even if it is misspelled or mistyped) and derives the most probable non-native word for the given context. The spelling tool consults a bilingual dictionary to determine possible non-native word translation candidates, a non-native language model (e.g., a trigram language model) to generate probabilities associated with the candidates given the current sentence or phrase context, and a translation model to generate probabilities of how likely a certain native word was intended given the non-native word candidates. From these probabilities, the spelling tool determines the most probable non-native word translation and substitutes the non-native word for the native input string. If the user likes the non-native word, the user may simply continue with the sentence. On the other hand, if the user is still unsure of the non-native word, the user can invoke a sentence recommendation tool that allows the user to see the non-native word in a bilingual sentence pair to learn how the word can be used.","Classifications

Ranking parser for a natural language processing system,US7143036B2,"
A natural language parse ranker of a natural language processing (NLP) system employs a goodness function to rank the possible grammatically valid parses of an utterance. The goodness function generates a statistical goodness measure (SGM) for each valid parse. The parse ranker orders the parses based upon their SGM values. It presents the parse with the greatest SGM value as the one that most likely represents the intended meaning of the speaker. The goodness function of this parse ranker is highly accurate in representing the intended meaning of a speaker. It also has reasonable training data requirements. With this parse ranker, the SGM of a particular parse is the combination of all of the probabilities of each node within the parse tree of such parse. The probability at a given node is the probability of taking a transition (“grammar rule”) at that point. The probability at a node is conditioned on highly predicative linguistic phenomena, such as “phrase levels,” “null transitions,” and “syntactic history”.","Classifications

Voice language translator,US4984177A,"
A voice language translator, suitable for implementation in hand-held size, is disclosed. The voice language translator includes: a key pad (20); a display system (17); a language cartridge(s) (45); a voice recognition module (49); a voice synthesizer (47); a speaker (39); a microphone (41); and a programmed CPU (43). Prior to use as a translator, the voice language translator is trained to the voice of a user. During training, a series of words and phrases to be spoken by the user are displayed, or spoken, in the language of the user. As the user speaks the words and phrases, the voice recognition circuit produces a digitally coded voice pattern that uniquely identifies the way in which the user spoke the words and phrases. The voice patterns produced by the voice recognition circuit are analyzed and stored, preferably in the cartridge. Thereafter, during translation, when the user speaks a sentence, the voice pattern produced by the voice recognition circuit is compared with the stored voice patterns to determine the nature of the spoken sentence. The result of the comparison is used to locate equivalent translations stored in the cartridge. Preferably, only sentences in the form of instructions or questions are translatable. Also, preferably, each question or instruction ends with a specific word unrelated to the content of the question, such as PLEASE. Strings of words and phrases that make up sentences are combinable only in a logical manner. Illogical combinations of words and phrases are ignored. This is accomplished by creating ""banks"" of combinable words and phrases in memory, and controlling via the CPU program the pathways therebetween such that only logical combinations are creatable. If the translator does not understand a spoken word or phrase, a list of acceptable words and phrases is displayed. Positioning a cursor adjacent the desired word or phrase and depressing an enter key allows the desired word or phrase to be selected. The logical string combinations of equivalent translations are converted to audible sounds by the voice synthesizer and emitted by the speaker. If desired, a visual display, or an audible emission, in the language of the user can be made to occur before the translated emission takes place (or simultaneously with the translated emission) so that the user can be certain that the sentence to be translated has been accurately interpreted by the voice language translator. The voice language translator also includes provisions for testing ""trained"" words or phrases and correcting erroneous training. Further, the voice language translator includes provisions for transferring ""trained"" voice patterns from one translation cartridge (e.g., an English-to-French cartridge) to another translation cartridge (e.g., English-to-French cartridge).","Classifications

Method and system for natural language translation,US5768603A,"
The present invention is a system for translating text from a first source language into a second target language. The system assigns probabilities or scores to various target-language translations and then displays or makes otherwise available the highest scoring translations. The source text is first transduced into one or more intermediate structural representations. From these intermediate source structures a set of intermediate target-structure hypotheses is generated. These hypotheses are scored by two different models: a language model which assigns a probability or score to an intermediate target structure, and a translation model which assigns a probability or score to the event that an intermediate target structure is translated into an intermediate source structure. Scores from the translation model and language model are combined into a combined score for each intermediate target-structure hypothesis. Finally, a set of target-text hypotheses is produced by transducing the highest scoring target-structure hypotheses into portions of text in the target language. The system can either run in batch mode, in which case it translates source-language text into a target language without human assistance, or it can function as an aid to a human translator. When functioning as an aid to a human translator, the human may simply select from the various translation hypotheses provided by the system, or he may optionally provide hints or constraints on how to perform one or more of the stages of source transduction, hypothesis generation and target transduction.","Classifications

Natural-language interface generating system,US4688195A,"
A system for interactively generating a natural-language input interface, without any computer-skill programming work being required. The natural-language menu interface thus generated provides a menu-selection technique whereby a totally unskilled computer user, who need not even be able to type, can access a relational or hierarchical database, without any possibility of error. That is, the user addresses commands to the database system simply by selecting words from an appropriate menu of words which could legally follow in commands, so that the user inputs commands which are phrased entirely in English, and these commands cannot be misunderstood by the database system. The present invention provides an automatic interactive system whereby such an interface is constructed. The database is itself loaded in, and the interactive interface-construction system then addresses a series of queries to the user's technical expert, in response to which the user must classify, which tables in the database are to be used, which attributes of particular tables in the database are key attributes, and, in particular, what the various connections between tables in the database are and what natural-language connecting phrases will describe those relations.","Classifications

Optimizing compiler using templates corresponding to portions of an intermediate language graph to determine an order of evaluation and to allocate lifetimes to temporary names for variables,US5613117A,"
A compiler framework uses a generic ""shell"" and a generic back end (where the code generator is target-specific). The generic back end provides the functions of optimization, register and memory allocation, and code generation. The code generation function of the back end may be targeted for any of a number of computer architectures. A front end is tailored for each different source language, such as Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, C, C++, etc. The front end scans and parses the source code modules, and generates from them an intermediate language representation of the source code programs expressed in the source code. The intermediate language represents any of the source code languages in a universal manner, so the interface between the front end and back end is of a standard format, and need not be rewritten for each language-specific front end. A feature is a method for doing code generation using code templates in a multipass manner. The selection and application of code templates occurs at four different times during the compilation process: (1) A pattern select phase does a pattern match in a context pass to select the best code templates; (2) Tasks of the context pass use context actions of the selected templates to analyze the evaluation order to expressions and to allocate temporary names; (3) A bind pass uses the binding actions of the selected templates to allocate template names; (4) Finally, a code pass uses code generation actions of the selected templates to guide the generation of object code.","Classifications

Language identification process using coded language words,US5548507A,"
Provides a process which identifies the language or genre of a stored or transmitted document. The process uses a plurality of Word Frequency Tables (WFTs) respectively associated with languages/genre of interest. Each WFT contains a relatively few of the most common words of one of the languages of interest. Each word code in a WFT has an associated normalized frequency of occurrence value (NFO); use of NFOs increases the language/genre detection ability of the process. A plurality of respective accumulators are associated with the plurality of WFTs. All accumulators are set to zero before identification processing starts. The language/genre identification process receives a sequence of words from an inputted document, and compares each received word to all of the words in all WFTs. Whenever a received word is found in any WFT, the process adds the word's associated NFO to a current total in the associated accumulator. In this manner, totals in all accumulators build up into language discriminating values after a number of words are read from the document. Processing stops when either the end of the document is reached or when a predetermined number of words are received; and then the language/genre associated with the accumulator containing the largest total is the identified language.","Classifications

Multimodal natural language interface for cross-application tasks,US5748974A,"
A multimodal natural language interface interprets user requests combining natural language input from the user with information selected from a current application and sends the request in the proper form to an appropriate auxiliary application for processing. The multimodal natural language interface enables users to combine natural language (spoken, typed or handwritten) input selected by any standard means from an application the user is running (the current application) to perform a task in another application (the auxiliary application) without either leaving the current application, opening new windows, etc., or determining in advance of running the current application what actions are to be done in the auxiliary application. The multimodal natural language interface carries out the following functions: (1) parsing of the combined multimodal input; (2) semantic interpretation (i.e., determination of the request implicit in the pars); (3) dialog providing feedback to the user indicating the systems understanding of the input and interacting with the user to clarify the request (e.g., missing information and ambiguities); (4) determination of which application should process the request and application program interface (API) code generation; and (5) presentation of a response as may be applicable. Functions (1) to (3) are carried out by the natural language processor, function (4) is carried out by the application manager, and function (5) is carried out by the response generator.","Classifications

Constrained natural language interface for a computer system,US5369575A,"
A user/computer interface is described that employ a constrained natural language-form input. The computer employs a feedback method to reinforce a user's confidence and knowledge that the computer comprehends a query or instruction. The user interface initially parses a user's natural language-form input into a case frame. The case frame is then filtered into a goal-expression that comprises a verb and remaining syntactical portions of the input query/instruction. The system then paraphrases the goal-expression into constrained natural language-form and communicates the paraphrase to the user for confirmation that the computer system has correctly interpreted the user input. The computer also compares the goal-expression with prestored goal-expressions to determine a match and then performs an action in response to a match being found.","Classifications

Method of identifying the language of a textual passage using short word and/or n-gram comparisons,US7359851B2,"
A method and system identifying the language of a textual passage is disclosed. The method and system includes parsing the textual passage into n-grams and assigning an initial weight to each n-gram, and adjusting the weight initially assigned to a word or n-gram parsed from the textual passage. The initially assigned weight is adjusted in a manner proportionate to the inverse of the number of languages within which such words or n-grams appear. Reducing the weight assigned to such words or n-grams diminishes—without completely eliminating—their importance in comparison to other words or n-grams parsed from the same textual passage when determining the language of a passage. The method and system of the present invention appropriately weighs the short words or n-grams common to multiple languages without affecting the short words or n-grams that are uncommon to several languages.","Classifications

Fast update implementation for efficient latent semantic language modeling,US6374217B1,"
Speech or acoustic signals are processed directly using a hybrid stochastic language model produced by integrating a latent semantic analysis language model into an n-gram probability language model. The latent semantic analysis language model probability is computed using a first pseudo-document vector that is derived from a second pseudo-document vector with the pseudo-document vectors representing pseudo-documents created from the signals received at different times. The first pseudo-document vector is derived from the second pseudo-document vector by updating the second pseudo-document vector directly in latent semantic analysis space in response to at least one addition of a candidate word of the received speech signals to the pseudo-document represented by the second pseudo-document vector. Updating precludes mapping a sparse representation for a pseudo-document into the latent semantic space to produce the first pseudo-document vector.

Robust language processor for segmenting and parsing-language containing multiple instructions,US5652897A,"
Apparatus and method are provided for segmenting, parsing, interpreting and formatting the content of instructions such as air traffic control instructions. Output from a speech recognizer is so processed to produce such instructions in a structured format such as for input to other software. There are two main components: an instruction segmenter and a robust parser. In the instruction segmenter, the recognized text produced by the speech recognizer is segmented into independent instructions and each instruction is processed. The instruction segmenter receives a recognized air traffic control or other instruction, and segments it into individual commands. Utterances or other language are thereby broken up into their component instructions by detecting probable instruction boundaries. If normal processing fails, then robust backup processing is invoked, as a fallback after a fixed time per word has elapsed or a processing failure has occurred. The robust parser allows the system to extract information from utterances that are not necessarily well formed or may have extraneous comments in them.","Classifications

Graphical user interface (GUI) language translator,US5974372A,"
A method of translating screen displays of a user application program from a first base language to a user-selectable second language. The method is driven by program software which intercepts the messages created by a presentation manager of a WINDOWS operating system, the messages being used to form screen displays of the user application program on the terminal. Initially, the untranslated text is moved from a displayed screen to a translation table. The user, who need not be a programmer or computer oriented, enters a translation of the text into the same table via the keyboard, the table then being stored in computer memory. Upon subsequent operation of the application program the message, which forms the screen to be displayed, will be intercepted. Subsequently, a search of the translation table for the text in the intercepted message is conducted. The matched text is replaced with the second language previously entered in the translation table. The translated message is then forwarded for display on the terminal screen. The method can either translate all designated application screens upon start up of the application program or can be individually translated as they appear on the terminal screen.","Classifications

A system and method for efficiently and relatively inexpensively providing a capability of translating “Patient Session Information” comprising IMD data and patient data stored in IMD memory in one human language and optionally other patient data from other sources into another human language. The local language translation is effected by first employing an Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) converter for converting Patient Session Information from an initial format, such as a memory dump format, ASCII format, a waveform format, a numeric format, or a binary format, to an XML format, thereby providing XML formatted Patient Session Information. Then, the XML formatted Patient Session Information is subjected to transformation by a human language specific Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) stylesheet into XSL transformed Patient Session Information. The XSL stylesheet effects translation of the XML formatted Patient Session Information into a language understandable to the user in an HTML format or another XML format or another suitable format, e.g., PDF or SVG graphic image formats. The XSL transformed Patient Session Information is thereby rendered understandable to the user that selects the human language when the translated Patient Session Information is delivered as by visual display or print-out or audible presentation or storage depending upon a selection of the user. The translated Patient Session Information can be stored in the programmer memory or in the IMD memory or transferred or exported to another device or system interconnected with the programmer including a remote server accessed through the Internet.","Classifications

A technique for processing natural language text uses a data structure that includes structure data in the text data. The structure data indicates an autonomous punctuational structure of the text, a punctuational structure that is independent of the lexical content of the text and therefore can be manipulated without considering the meaning of the words in the text. The data structure can be a tree in which each node has a textual type such as a paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word. The data structure could alternatively be parallel data sequences, one with codes indicating the text's characters and the other with codes indicating textual types. The data structure is produced and maintained using a grammar of textual types, indicating for each textual type the textual types of units into which it can properly be divided. During editing, a text sequence is generated by applying rendering rules to the data structure, and the text is presented to the user based on the text sequence. Prior to generating the text sequence, information relating to punctuational features is propagated through the data structure. User signals requesting editing operations are applied to modify the data structure using operations rules, and the user's pointing or selecting signals are mapped onto the data structure. The modified data structure is checked with the grammar of textual types to ensure that it has an autonomous punctuational structure. A modified text sequence is then generated, and a modified text is displayed based on it.","Classifications

Menu-based natural language understanding system,US4829423A,"
A natural language interface for a computer system restricts inputs from a user to those which generate valid input sentences. The user selects a next input word from a menu showing which words are valid. When an input is selected, a parser uses a predefined grammar to determine which words are valid continuations after the selected word, and whether a complete sentence has been entered. Valid next words are presented to the user in menu form so that a next selection can be made. If an ambiguous complete sentence is entered, the interface allows the user to select the desired meaning therefor. The grammer can be context free grammar, and can use an associated lexicon to define elements therein.","Classifications

Natural language speech recognition using slot semantic confidence scores related to their word recognition confidence scores,US6567778B1,"
A stream of input speech is coupled as an input to a speech recognizer. The speech can be provided to the speech recognizer directly from a user or first stored and provided from a memory circuit. Each input word is recognized by the speech recognizer and a word confidence score is associated with each corresponding recognized word. The recognized words and their associated word confidence scores are provided to a natural language interpreter which parses the stream of recognized words into predetermined edges. From the edges, the natural language interpreter forms semantic slots which represent a semantic meaning. A slot confidence score related to the word or phone confidence scores for each of the words in the slot is determined for each slot. Based upon the slot confidence score, an ancillary application program determines whether to accept the words used to fill each slot. If the slot is rejected, the application program can request the user to repeat the information necessary to fill that slot only, rather than requiring the user to repeat the entire stream of input speech.","Classifications

Applying traps to a printed page specified in a page description language format,US5295236A,"
A trapping technique which accepts a Postscript or other page description language (PDL) file and outputs a file in PDL format having the correct traps. The input page is first divided into sub-portions, or tiles, and the tiles are individually processed by evaluating the input file in a corresponding clipping window. Each tile is then analyzed to determine where edges exist. The edge data is fed to an edge converter which produces a list of color transitions consisting of the analytic description of each edge and the color information along the sides of the edge. The color transition information is fed to a trapping analyzer which generates trap vectors in accordance with a set of desired trapping rules. The trap vectors are then converted to PDL form. As a final step, the trap vectors are added to the original PDL file. The final trapped page may be printed on standard typesetters without the need for special trap generator hardware.","Classifications

Process for sexing cow embryos,US5876942A,"
A rapid, highly reproducible and sensitive technique has been successfully developed for sexing the cow embryos, by method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against the amelogenin (bAML) genes located on both X- and Y-chromosomes of the Holstein dairy cattle. Results from DNA sequence analysis showed that there was only 45% homology between the intron 5 of AMLX and AMLY genes. Based on these sequences a pair of sex-specific primers, pbAML5XY(+) and pbAML5XY (-),were designed allowing to amplify a single fragment of 476-bp from the female cattle and two fragments of 476-bp and 341-bp from the male ones, respectively. The most important feature is that the precise sensitivity of sex-determination was confirmed to be reached as minimum template as trace amount of genomic DNA content in either a single lymphocyte or a single blastomere isolated from cow embryo at day-6 to day-7. Moreover, neither those of complicated procedures for purifying the DNA prior the PCR nor any extra pair of primers for serving as internal control is thought to be essential and the sex-determination of over hundred embryos can be completed at once within 4hrs.","Classifications

"Meat-containing, strip-shaped food product and method of making same",US8309157B2,"
A flexible, strip-shaped food product is made by comminuting substantially frozen meat and heating the comminuted meat to at least partially denature the meat proteins and cooling the cooked meat. About 4% by weight to about 45% by weight of wheat flour is admixed with the cooked meat, along with other ingredients, to form a dough. Use of the wheat flour unexpectedly increases tensile strength of the dough and products baked from the dough, and maintains flexibility of the strip-shaped food products over an extended period of time. Cooking of the meat in the presence of salt unexpectedly increases water activity of the pieces, resulting in a product that has a skin and a moist middle, while maintaining tensile strength. The dough is rotary-molded into strip-shaped pieces. The rotary mold may have angled die cups. The strip-shaped dough pieces are then baked and dried.","Classifications

Fossil fuel consumption is substantially reduced, even eliminated, and 100% of the cattle waste is treated in digesters wherein it is converted into medium-BTU gas (bio-gas), organic fertilizer and bio-compost. The ethanol unit serves the purposes of ethanol production, grain pretreatment to produce feed for the cattle and production of a thin stillage which is fed to the digesters. The grain is first processed in the ethanol unit, where the starch portion is converted into ethanol and CO2. The remaining portion is separated into the thin stillage and a wet cake which is fed directly to cattle as a superior ruminant animal ration which displaces certain traditional feed components, alters the standard starch to protein ratio, and significantly improves conversion efficiencies and meat/milk quality.","Classifications

The dry filtered product is assayed to verify the immunological activity of the product and to measure the distribution and concentration of pathogen specific antibodies. The dry filtered product is stored. Subsequently, a dose of the product containing at least a minimum weight ratio of immunologically active Ig is fed to the newborn animal to transfer passive immunity. Ion exchange techniques can be combined with ultrafiltration techniques to significantly increase the Ig concentration in the ultimate product while simultanously reducing the net cost of producing the product. They whey-derived product may also be used on a continuous basis as a food supplement for an animal to enable the immunologically active immunoglobulin molecules in the product to attack pathogens present in the digestive system of the animal.","Classifications

Process for reducing fat content of pork skin and products made therefrom,US6033715A,"
A process is disclosed for the calculated removal of fat from pork skin. Pork skin is subjected to tumbling cycles during which the pork skin is tumbled first in warm water and subsequently in warm water containing salt and concentrated laundry detergent. As this two step cycle is repeated, fat contained within the pork skin separates and is drained from the pork skin with the rinse water. The cycle may be repeated until the pork skin contains a desired percentage of fat. The process does not require that the pork skin be ground or otherwise comminuted in order to selectively remove fat from the material, nor does the process use harsh solvents or chemicals that might render the pork skin inedible or toxic. Because the process is all natural, the reduced fat whole pork skin is edible and may be formed into a variety of canine treats through additional processing and cooking. These canine treat products may include knotted bones, twisted products, chips, filled bones, sticks, patties and various ground products.","Classifications

The product is made by preparing chunks of lean meat substantially free of fat, gristle and sinew. The muscle scaffold network is slackened e.g., by multiple severing of the connective tissue of the lean meat chunks. These chunks then are massaged under reduced pressure to produce the protein exudate, while sufficient water is added to obtain a desired protein-to-moisture ratio. Fat trimmings are ground and blended into an emulsion which is simultaneously extruded with the lean meat chunks through separate but adjacent extrusion heads which may be shaped to produce a product resembling a steak, roast or other conventional cut of natural meat. The product has uniform, reproducible characteristics of appearance, size, weight, shrinkage on cooking, juiciness, taste and texture.","Classifications

A method is described comprising stunning a ruminant at a packing plant, and thereafter measuring tissue characteristics of the ruminant using a tissue imaging and analysis device prior to processing the ruminant to a carcass. Working embodiments of the method have used an ultrasound tissue imaging and analysis device, although other analyses also can be performed. The ultrasound analysis can be performed by one operator, or plural operators. For example, if the device is an ultrasound tissue analysis device, the step of conveying may first comprise conveying the ruminant to a position adjacent a first operator. The first operator applies an ultrasound image enhancing fluid to the ruminant's hide, and a second operator places the ultrasound tissue analysis device adjacent the enhancing fluid and performs ultrasound tissue imaging and analysis on the ruminant. The method can be used to, amongst other things, measure backfat and rib eye dimensions, obtain an ultrasound image, and determine rib eye area and marbling using the measured tissue characteristics. This data can then be used to perform grading calculations, such as to determine quality and/or yield grades. A method for processing and managing ruminants and ruminant products in feedlots and packing plants also is described comprising first measuring internal tissue characteristics and/or external body dimensions of ruminants at a feedlot. Information obtained concerning each ruminant is stored in a computer or on computer-readable medium.

Neutralization of food allergens by thioredoxin,US5792506A,"
Thioredoxin, a small dithiol protein, is a specific reductant for major allergenic proteins present in widely used foods from animal and plant sources. All targeted allergenic proteins contain disulfide (S--S) bonds that are reduced to the sulfhydryl (SH) level by thioredoxin. The proteins are allergenically active in the oxidized (S--S) state. When reduced (SH state), they lose their allergenicity. Thioredoxin achieved this reduction when activated (reduced) either by NADPH via NADP-thioredoxin reductase (physiological conditions) or by dithiothreitol, a chemical reductant. Skin tests and feeding experiments carried out with sensitized dogs showed that treatment of the food with reduced thioredoxin prior to ingestion eliminated or decreased the allergenicity of the food.","Classifications

Food supplement and use thereof for elevating levels of essential fatty acids in livestock and products therefrom,US7001610B2,"
This invention describes feed supplement, and processes which increase the amount of essential fatty acids in the milk, eggs, meat and other by-products from animals including dairy cattle, beef cattle, goats and poultry. The food supplement described herein includes specific fish meal, fish oil, algae or plant dietary supplements combined with a natural ingredient/coating mixture, which can be either talc, clay or combinations; or mixtures of talc or clay with flax sprout powder to achieve enhanced levels of the essential fatty acids in the milk, eggs, meat and processed livestock products from animals fed this dietary supplement. In ruminants, the natural ingredient/coating mixture prevents microbial degradation of the essential fatty acids in the rumen stomach of the animals fed with this composition, thus providing more of the essential fatty acids to the animal, for their use. This in turn results in improved concentrations in the milk, meat and processed products from these animals. Poultry fed with this food supplement also have a higher concentration of essential fatty acids in their eggs and meat.","Classifications

The present invention includes a method of formulating ruminant feed to selectively change a composition of milk produced by the ruminant. The method includes providing a fistula directly into an abomasum of the ruminant. A selected feed component at a selected level is introduced directly into the abomasum through the ingress. The selected feed component thereby bypasses other portions of the ruminant's stomach. The direct introduction of the selected feed component allows for changing a selected characteristic of the composition of milk. The composition of the milk corresponding to the selected feed component is then analyzed. The direct introduction of the selected feed component is repeated, if necessary, at other selected levels. The milk produced corresponding to the other selected levels is then analyzed. A selected quantity of the rumen inert feed component to be fed orally to the ruminant is determined by utilizing the analysis of the composition of the milk corresponding to the introduction of the selected feed component into the abomasum of the ruminant.","Classifications

Rapid, accurate and almost automatic determination of fat in comminuted meat products, such as beef and the like, is obtained by exposing a preweighed sample to microwave energy for a period of time sufficient to achieve a relatively constant chemical analysis in the residue. During heating, a substantial portion of the fat is melted, leaves the sample and is collected, while a substantial portion of the moisture is vaporized and released directly as vapor. The sample, its residue after heating, less released fat and moisture, and the collected fat are all weighed and the weight is recorded. By cooking the sample using microwave energy to the point short of decomposition of appreciable protein, fat, etc., some fat, moisture and protein remain in the residue. Accurate determination of these components is then calculated automatically because the residue is at a constant chemical analysis relative to the original composition which is directly related to the amount of fat and moisture rendered from the sample.","Classifications

The thermal energy radiated is focused onto a plurality of means for absorbing energy from the infrared radiation, specifically a two-dimensional array of gas cells with the front end being a rigid infrared transparent window, the sides being rigid, and the rear ends being flexible membranes. Infrared radiation absorbed by the cells causes changes in the thermodynamic pressure within each cell and consequent expansion of the flexible membrane on the rear end of each cylindrical cell. The deflection of these flexible membranes is monitored and measured by either a laser interferometer system or a solid state pressure sensing system. Measurement of this deflection represents the amount of infrared radiation received at each of the plurality of gas cells. The resultant intensity of the laser interference beam is monitored with a laser interferometer and a TV vidicon camera. This resultant intensity reflects the magnitude of deflection from the cells. The TV vidicon signal which monitors the resultant intensity is processed and transmitted for two-dimensional video presentation of the viewed scene.","Classifications

Apparatus and method for transferring entropy with the aid of a thermodynamic cycle,US6470679B1,"
The invention relates to regenerative working and thermal processes, the drive energy of which is supplied by external combustion of the fuel. The heat supply for this, almost always assumed to be isothermic, is achieved only in exceptional cases, since the flue gases usually have a low specific thermal capacity. The invention explains new types of processes in order to obtain the optimum thermodynamic efficiency even for these less efficient heating cases. The heating heat exchangers and thermal regenerators used in regenerative processes are replaced by regenerative heat exchangers, which comprise a plurality of short regenerators, which are connected by tubular heat exchangers for the heating medium. It is thereby possible to supply the heat to the process not at a fixed but at a sliding temperature. In the same way, regenerative coolers are used for the dissipation of heat from Stirling engines and regenerative heat pumps or refrigeration machines, if, for example, only air is available as heat transfer medium.","Classifications

In the bottoming cycle a mixture of a first gas such as helium or hydrogen and a fine dispersed low-temperature non-freezable lubricating liquid is polytropically compressed in a compressor and then the liquid content is separated from the first gas. The separated first gas is isobarically heated using heat from the second gas and then the heated first gas is adiabatically expanded and cooled while performing useful work and thereafter is fed to the compressor and mixed with the separated liquid to serve as a coolant and facilitate rejection of polytropic heat and to supplement the cool gas/liquid mixture providing polytropic compression of the first gas and thus completing the bottoming cycle. The low-temperature bottoming cycle functions to cool the second working fluids of the open or closed modified Brayton topping cycles before their compression. The power system using a high temperature heat source can generate a large amount of specific power to achieve a high actual thermal efficiency greater than 0.8.","Classifications

Method for thermodynamic cycle,US4442675A,"
A working fluid in the gaseous state at some initial temperature and pressure is expanded polytropically to a resulting exhaust fluid (vapor and liquid) having some lower pressure at some lower temperature in order to produce useful work. The exhaust fluid is then, in a manner approaching constant enthalpy, compressed to the working fluid's nominal original high pressure. Thereafter, the fluid undergoes constant pressure heating to restore its initial state. Of the several methods described for achieving isenthalpic compression, the preferred method uses an isenthalpic compression apparatus which educts the exhaust fluid vapors into a throat located between a motive fluid inlet nozzle and a wider recompression outlet. After eduction, and entrainment into the motive fluid, the exhaust vapors are recompressed by the deceleration produced at the recompression outlet. Thereafter the working fluid and motive fluid are separated. The motive fluid at elevated pressure consists of liquid in quantities sufficient to accomplish gas recompression with surplus quantities being returned to reservoir storage.","Classifications

The basic principles and technology in generation of the data is the well understood action of a solute upon the solvent vapor pressure above the solution. By observing the effect of a sample solute on the temperature/vapor pressure properties of a solvent, if is possible by known methods to determine its average aggregate mass. When dealing with a solute material that tends to form clusters, however, the average aggregate mass found is an apparent average aggregate mass, i.e. the average aggregate mass of all of the particles, which are the clusters and any unassociated molecules, if any. To determine the true average aggregate mass, a method employing the determined apparent average aggregate masses, referred to herein as the BRD method, is used. Since the method is based upon cluster thermodynamics and equilibrium properties, it reflects more accurately the behavior of the clusters at various dilutions. The method provides a basis for the prediction of thermodynamic and equilibrium properties, which was not possible with previous methods.","Classifications

"Operating mode for internal combustion engine ""adelshin aggregate phase thermodynamic cycle for internal combustion engine"" and engine, operating with said cycle",US20040050038A1,"
The invention relates to propulsion engineering in particular to improvement of thermodynamic cycle, as operation mode of internal combustion engine.
An aggregate-phase thermodynamic cycle consists in a consecutive and interrelated changing of thermodynamic parameters of an exhaust gas, as a working medium of an internal combustion engine, resulted from energetic separation in a swirl chamber, incorporated with an engine into a single thermodynamic system with formation of a single closed volume. Here the consecutive impacts of considerable high and low temperatures bring about aggregate-phase changes of a working medium. At the top temperature limit there is a possibility of ionizing of all exhaust gases, in one option; partial ionization in another option. At the bottom temperature limit there is a possibility of condensation of all exhaust gases in a closed volume in one option, or a part of them in another option. Which consecutively leads to creation of a stable and considerable vacuum in this closed volume. This causes new attributes for the completion of a positive working stroke by an engine expansion machine, as a vacuum engine.
For the achievement of the specified technical effect, with the reference to the known from the level of engineering of an internal combustion engine design, containing the machine of volumetric expansion communicating with the swirl chamber of energetic separation, it is preferable, according to the invention, to execute the engine design so that the machine of volumetric expansion of the engine and swirl chamber of energetic separation form a single closed volume with a common interdependent thermodynamic parameters with the opportunity of a vacuum creation on this volume.

Method and apparatus for estimating flow in compressors with sidestreams,US6503048B1,"
Accurate and effective antisurge control for turbocompressor stages is augmented by measuring the flow rate of fluid entering or leaving the stage of compression. On the other hand, turbocompressors with sidestreams, such as ethylene, propylene, and propane refrigeration compressors, pose unique antisurge control challenges; in particular, measurements for the flow rate entering (or leaving) the compressors' middle stages are not available in most cases. Furthermore, the methods used to cope with this lack of flow measurements are prone to introducing errors and producing false transients, as well as being cumbersome and difficult to implement. For these reasons, this disclosure relates to a method for protecting turbocompressors with sidestreams from the damaging effects of surge. But more specifically, it describes a technique for estimating the reduced flow rate entering a compression stage not having a flow measurement device in its suction or discharge—that is, the flow rate entering a middle (intermediate) compressor stage can be inferred from known flow rates. The reduced flow rate is used to determine a location of the compression stage's operating point relative to its surge limit. The proposed method employs (1) the first law of thermodynamics to estimate the temperature of a flow entering one of the compressor stages, and (2) a relationship between the pressures and temperatures in suction and discharge used in conjunction with the first law of thermodynamics.","Classifications

Symmetry Graphical Method in Thermodynamics,US20170242936A9,"
From a mathematical point of view, thermodynamic properties behave like multi-variable functions and can usually be differentiated and integrated. Many thermodynamic equations with similar function forms could be resolved into families. The members of a family with ‘patterned self-similarity’ can precisely be defined as symmetrical functions, which are left invariant not only in function form, but also in variable nature and relationship under symmetrical operations. The simplest and must evident symmetrical operations happen in the geometrical symmetry of a physical object. Therefore it is possible to employ geometry to reveal symmetry in thermodynamics, incorporate the symmetry to develop a coherent and complete structure (a diagram or model) of thermodynamic variables, and facilitate the subject with the symmetry. In this invented method you can find out that (1) A variety of (totally forty four) thermodynamic variables are properly arranged at vertices of an extended concentric multi-polyhedron based on their physical meanings. (2) Numerous (more than three hundreds) equations of twelve families can concisely be depicted by overlapping specific movable graphical patterns on fixed diagrams through symmetrical operations.

Method and apparatus for diagnosing problems with the thermodynamic performance of a heat engine,US5073862A,"
A method and apparatus measured and calculates the derived thermodynamic state of a heat-pump or air conditioning system using information from transducers sensing elementary thermodynamic variables in the system. Elementary signals such as pressure, temperature, power, humidity, air flow, and others as required are derived using transducers from closed and open portions of the thermodynamic system, and which signals are then transmitted using appropriate transmission media. These signals are input to a computer, which could take many forms (electrical analog, electrical digital, pneumatic, hydraulic, and others), and these signal inputs along with known and tabulated thermodynamic characteristics of the working fluid (refrigerant) and psychrometric properties of the cooled media (air for example), are used to calculate thermodynamic output variables such as entropy, enthalpy, pressure, temperature, and volume at various states in the thermodynamic cycle. The output variables can be presented in tabulated or graphic form for clear understanding such as pressure vs. volume, temperature vs. entropy, or pressure vs. enthalpy graphs of the working system. The derived data can be used to determine efficiency and operating condition of the heat-pump or air-conditioning system and can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of the cause of a malfunctioning or inefficient system. Using artificial intelligence in an ""expert"" system, diagnosis could be completely automated.","Classifications

Conversion of available energy,US4381462A,"
Solar energy (called energy to the extent it is thermodynamically useful) is focussed by an inflated, buoyant reflector for heating lithium circulating through an MHD conversion system. Hydrogen and nitrogen are added to the heated lithium, finely divided iron serving as catalyst to obtain lithium amid. The hydrogen has been produced by electrolysis of water. The lithium-lithium amid mixture (liquid) is mixed with pressurized nitrogen to obtain a two phase flow in which the liquid is accelerated; focussed into a jet passing through the MHD converter to obtain hydrazine and additional electrical energy e.g. for the hydrogen electrolysis; and returned to the solar heater. The gas (N2) is separated; subjected to recuperative heat exchange with itself; and low temperature isothermic compression under direct contact with a liquid which in turn is, ultimately, air cooled. The entire assembly is of elongated construction wherein the main active elements are arranged along a center axis e.g. as part of a central tubing surrounded by smaller tubing which section-wise runs various fluids to their appropriate destinations while serving as support frame. The entire process runs on the basis of self-sustaining fluid circulations without moving parts; the thermo and hydrodynamics as well as the electromagnetic interactions are explained and mathematically analyzed. The use of hydrazine as universal fuel is explained on the basis of compatibility with the biosphere.

Separation of carbon dioxide from gas mixtures by calcium based reaction separation,US8226917B2,"
A reaction-based process has been developed for the selective removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from a multicomponent gas mixture to provide a gaseous stream depleted in CO2 compared to the inlet CO2 concentration in the stream. The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases (such as flue gas/fuel gas) by its reaction with metal oxides (such as calcium oxide). The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO2 (CaRS—CO2) process consists of contacting a CO2 laden gas with calcium oxide (CaO) in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO2 by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCOa). Once “spent”, CaCO3 is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO2. The “regenerated” CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO2. This carbonation-calcination cycle forms the basis of the CaRS—CO2 process. This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO3 structure, developed by a process detailed elsewhere, that attains >90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles. Lastly, thermal regeneration (calcination) under vacuum provided a better sorbent structure that maintained reproducible reactivity levels over multiple cycles.","Classifications

Process for pyrolytic heat recovery enhanced with gasification of organic material,US7452392B2,"
This invention is a reactor and a process for the conversion of organic waste material such as municipal trash, sewage, post-consumer refuse, and biomass to commercially salable materials.
The invention produces the following:
1. Maximum energy conversion from the organic material
2. High volume consumption of the organic feed material
3. Less pollution of gaseous products than prior art systems
4. Solid residuals for disposal are minimal and non-hazardous.
The conversion is accomplished by combining anaerobic gasification and pyrolysis of the feed organic material and making it into synthetic gas. The synthetic gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons (CxHy), hydrogen, and carbon monoxide with small amounts of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. An essential feature of the invention is a hot driver gas, devoid of free oxygen and rich in water, which supplies the entire thermal and chemical energy needed for the reactions. This hot driver gas is produced by complete sub-stoichiometric combustion of the fuel (CxHy) before it enters the reactor.","Classifications

Process for removal of hydrogen sulfide from gas streams,US4311683A,"
A process for the removal of H2 S from a feed gas, and the production of sulfur therefrom, is effected by oxidation with oxygen and/or SO2 at temperatures between 250° and 450° F. The oxidation is conducted in the presence of an extremely stable oxidation catalyst comprising an oxide and/or sulfide of vanadium supported on a non-alkaline porous refractory oxide. Sulfur deposition and consequent catalyst deactivation are prevented by maintaining the partial pressure of free sulfur in the oxidation reactor below that necessary for condensation. H2, CO, and light hydrocarbons present in the feed gas are not oxidized. Typical uses of the process include the removal of H2 S and the production of sulfur from sour natural gases or gases obtained from the gasification of coal.
Feed gases which contain SO2 and H2 S in mole ratios greater than 0.5, or which contain other gaseous sulfur compounds such as COS, CS2, SO3 and mercaptans, can be desulfurized by hydrogenating all of such sulfur components to H2 S and subsequently removing the H2 S from the hydrogenated feed gas by the oxidation process of the invention. This hydrogenation-oxidation combination is especially contemplated for the desulfurization of Claus tail gases and stack gas effluents.","Classifications

Method for identification of mutations using ligation of multiple oligonucleotide probes,US6025139A,"
A ligase-based assay which relies only upon knowledge of the wild-type sequence of a gene or gene fragment is used to detect all types of mutations, i.e., point mutations, insertions and deletions. The assay makes use of a set of oligonucleotide probes, which may be packaged in kit form, which hybridize in series along the length of the gene. The ligation of the probes together form a ligation product, the size of which is evaluated. When the gene or gene fragment being analyzed corresponds to the normal sequence and thus perfectly matches the probes, all of the probes in the set are ligated together, and the ligation produce has a certain resulting size. When a mutation appears in the gene, the hybridization of the probe overlapping the mutation is impaired, with the result that some or all of the ligation produce is of smaller size. By evaluating the size of the ligation product, both the existence of a mutation and its approx. position can be identified.","Classifications

Heat transfer apparatus, whether in panel or tubular form, comprises bimetallic laminations, at least one of the metals being ferromagnetic. A temperature differential causes thermoelectric current circulation (in effect, a d.c. eddy-current) within each lamination which develops a magnetizing H-field. A transverse electric potential may also be used to enhance thermoelectric activity across a bimetallic junction. The ferromagnetic B-field enhancement develops in turn a circulating diamagnetic reaction current which augments the thermoelectric activity and causes an overriding thermal feedback and bistable direction-of-heat-flow operation. Control involves the priming action of an applied electric and/or magnetic field or preheating by electrical resistors in the heat sinks. Application in a thermally powered electric transformer generator is described.","Classifications

Adiabatic positive displacement machinery,US4663938A,"
Adiabatic positive displacement gas cycle machinery is designed with explicit control of the heat flow between the gas and the walls. The control is achieved by maintaining near-laminar flow and a small wall area to volume ratio. The most stable near-laminar flow in a cylinder is an axial vortex because of symmetry, and hence the induction port design should establish an axial vortex and a low velocity. Induction and exhaust port designs to achieve this flow are applied to a vane pump, an adiabatic air compressor, a diesel engine, and two and four stroke Otto cycle engines. The gain in thermal efficiency for these designs can be significant, up to a factor of 2, since the largest inefficiency in nearly all positive displacement machinery is imperfect control of heat flow.","Classifications

Artificial neural network and fuzzy logic based boiler tube leak detection systems,US6192352B1,"
Power industry boiler tube failures are a major cause of utility forced outages in the United States, with approximately 41,000 tube failures occurring every year at a cost of $5 billion a year. Accordingly, early tube leak detection and isolation is highly desirable. Early detection allows scheduling of a repair rather than suffering a forced outage, and significantly increases the chance of preventing damage to adjacent tubes. The instant detection scheme starts with identification of boiler tube leak process variables which are divided into universal sensitive variables, local leak sensitive variables, group leak sensitive variables, and subgroup leak sensitive variables, and which may be automatically be obtained using a data driven approach and a leak sensitivity function. One embodiment uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to learn the map between appropriate leak sensitive variables and the leak behavior. The second design philosophy integrates ANNs with approximate reasoning using fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets. In the second design, ANNs are used for learning, while approximate reasoning and inference engines are used for decision making. Advantages include use of already monitored process variables, no additional hardware and/or maintenance requirements, systematic processing does not require an expert system and/or a skilled operator, and the systems are portable and can be easily tailored for use on a variety of different boilers.","Classifications

Instantaneous saturation values are employed to gauge the amount of interaction in the lungs between the breathable liquid and respiratory gas flowing therein and to control selected feedback operations to maintain the maximum possible amount of interaction therebetween. The saturation level of expiratory gas is also employed to optimize operating parameters or a system for recovering the breathable liquid from the expiratory gas, directly from the patient, or from a gas or liquid ventilator. The saturation level or expiratory gas is also employed to perform functional residual capacity studies and to correct for errors in conventional functional residual capacity measurements performed while a patient undergoes partial liquid ventilation. When breathable liquid is employed as a blood substitute, the quantification or the loss of the breathable liquid from volatilization and transpiration helps to determine when to replenish the breathable liquid in the bloodstream.

If the treated material is located in a subsurface earth formation, the AC current may further generate gases in situ to assist in moving and circulating the leaching solution in the formation and to bring the dissolved mineral value to the surface through a borehole or the like. This acceleration of the chemical reactions can shorten the effective leaching time from weeks or months to a matter of hours or days, thereby greatly affecting the rate of recovery of the mineral value and making such leach mining economical on a commercial basis.","Classifications

"Hydrogen and oxygen battery, or hudrogen and oxygen to fire a combustion engine and/or for commerce.",US20020100836A1,"
The present invention is directed to a method of and an apparatus for the disassociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen via a thermolysis, heat/ignition process. The hydrogen and oxygen produced may be burned as fuel in a hydrogen thermolysis reactor to provide propellant for a turbine or to provide heat to generate steam for a steam engine or may be combusted in a combustion engine. The present invention can produce heat for space heat for buildings and for manufacturing, etc. or can produce mechanical drive that can generate electricity, power hydraulic systems, or provide thrust to propel airplanes, spaceships, rockets or submarines (which have their own oxygen supply for combustion in outer space or underwater from the oxygen contained in the water converted into hydrogen and oxygen) and can provide the energy needed to power automobiles, trucks, buses, trains, boats, etc. A heat/ignition process is utilized to accomplish complete thermolysis and burning of water: A thermolysis coil located at the core of the hydrogen thermolysis reactor preheats the water under pressure until it reaches a temperature of approximately 2500 deg. F., without intense pressure the water would become gaseous; and, the water is heated by a resistance electrical current or by masers and/or by lasers before it is ejected from the coil and becomes heated to approximately 5000 deg. F. Most of the water will dissociate into hydrogen and oxygen within the liquid state due to extreme temperature and pressure, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics; and, in the final step the water is ejected from the high-pressure, high-temperature thermolysis coil into a vacuum zone of negative-pressure and high-temperature created by a hydraulically operated vacuum turbine within the thermolysis nozzle and is transformed into fuel plasma containing atomic hydrogen and atomic oxygen. The plasma passes through an electric arc capable of temperatures up to 90,000 deg. F. or passes through laser beams capable of temperatures of up to one million deg. F. within the vacuum inside the thermolysis nozzle and the hydrogen and oxygen is further heated and is ignited by the electric arc or laser beams. The burning hydrogen and oxygen is diffused into the hydrogen thermolysis reactor's core by the vacuum turbine. A self-sustained cycle is created because the hydrogen and oxygen (disassociated water) that burns provides the heat/energy to perform work, including the generation of electricity for the resistance electrical current or masers and/or lasers and electric arc or lasers, and to heat additional water in the thermolysis coil and enormous quantities of excess energy for any other useful purpose.","Classifications

The invention relates to a desalination method and system that uses freeze crystallization technology that incorporates the use of compressed air energy as the source for freezing temperatures. When compressed air is released by a turbo expander, chilled air is produced as a by-product, wherein the chilled air is introduced into a crystallization chamber. Also injected into the chamber is a spray cloud of seawater droplets, which has been pre-chilled by heat exchange with the cold chamber walls, and which is then circulated and exposed to the chilled air in the chamber. The sizes of the droplets can vary, but are preferably predetermined, along with the relative temperatures, flows and speeds of the spray and chilled air, such that when the droplets are circulated within the chilled air, and settle at the bottom of the chamber, they are deposited at slightly above the eutectic temperature. This way, the ice/snow mass that forms at the bottom of the chamber will consist of frozen ice crystals, and a residue of salt water brine, which can runoff from the mass, either from the sides, or through any voids or channels that may form within the mass.","Classifications

A device is suitable both for determining with high accuracy and precision the temperature of the human body (surface temperature, temperature in layers next to the surface, temperature in bodily cavities, temperature gradient towards the inside of the body) and for detecting output units. Their measurement accuracy and precision is higher than that of conventional temperature and heat measurement devices. The device further allows temperature measurement and heat detection with a high spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, because of the high correlation discovered between the glucose concentration in human blood and body temperature and heat measured at certain points of the body, the device is extraordinarily suitable for non-invasively and even contactlessly determining the glucose concentration in parts of the human body, in particular the human blood.","Classifications

"Process for producing power, fresh water, and food from the sea and sun",US3928145A,"
Solar energy absorbed in surface waters of tropic and sub-tropic seas may be increased by more heat which can be added by intensive solar heaters. The warm sea water, when flash evaporated, gives vapors which may be passed through a heat engine to give power, then condensed at a lower pressure to give fresh water. Heat of condensation is removed by circulating sea water from a depth, often of only a few thousand feet. This is cold, and has considerable nutrients coming from the degradation of sea life. These nutrients are used in known mariculture systems to grow commercial food fish. Various arrangements of flows of the several liquid streams give different variations to produce power and/or fresh water in addition to food fish. These modifications may be optimized with various systems, some of which are well known, but novel in this usage, including the use of a second thermodynamic fluid, conventional multistage flash evaporation, also two of its variation: - controlled flash evaporation and vapor reheat.","Classifications

High energy X-ray inspection system for detecting nuclear weapons materials,US6347132B1,"
An x-ray inspection system for automatically detecting nuclear weapons materials generates a high energy x-ray fan beam or a traveling x-ray pencil beam that traverses an object under inspection. An x-ray detector detects x-ray energy that passes through the object and provides a detected signal indicative thereof. The detected signal is processed to detect the presence of an area of very high x-ray attenuation within the object under inspection, which is indicative of nuclear weapons materials. Because of the high atomic number (Z) and high density of nuclear weapons materials Uranium and Plutonium, both of these materials attenuate (i.e., absorb) incident x-rays significantly more than ordinary materials. That is, very high Z materials such as nuclear weapons materials, produce no x-rays outside of their block of material because the x-rays are self absorbed within the very high Z materials. Therefore, these materials can be detected by a transmission detectors, or by combining the readings from transmission and scatter detectors, if a pencil beam system is employed.","Classifications

The detection system can be used over the course of the cargo transport, thereby enabling finely tuned monitoring for fissile material across distances of many meters extending through surrounding cargo containers.

Contractable sections of the web, made of cable-like structures, connected to perimeter masses, act as drawstrings upon collision with flying object. This causes closure of the web around the flying object as a result of the mass's inertia and added resistance from deployable resistance structures that place tension on drawstring structures of the web.

Underground nuclear power station using self-regulating heat-pipe controlled reactors,US4851183A,"
A nuclear reactor for generating electricity is disposed underground at the bottom of a vertical hole that can be drilled using conventional drilling technology.

Additionally, the primary coolant (consisting of the working flud in the heat pipes in the reactor core) moderates neutrons and regulates their reactivity, thus keeping the power of the reactor substantially constant. At the end of its useful life, the reactor core may be abandoned in place. Isolation from the atmosphere in case of accident or for abandonment is provided by the operation of explosive closures and mechanical valves emplaced along the hole. This invention combines technology developed and tested for small, highly efficient, space-based nuclear electric power plants with the technology of fast-acting closure mechanisms developed and used for underground testing of nuclear weapons.

For example, it is well understood that a chemical gas attack is likely to be less effective when it is raining than when it is clear because the rain will suppress and dilute the chemical agent. Therefore, the likelihood of a chemical gas attack is higher when it is clear. In light of this and similar knowledge, the illustrative embodiment checks for evidence of an attack more frequently and with great acuity than when the ambient environmental (e.g., meteorological, etc.) characteristics (e.g., whether is it precipitating or not, whether it is sunny or not, etc) suggest that an attack is more likely. This enables the embodiment to conserve consumables that are used in detecting attacks for when the attacks are more likely.","Classifications

The construction, disposition, arrangement and shapes of the structures are such that people inside these structures are not affected by the blast of the nuclear explosion, for peak overpressure levels well above those which conventional structures cannot survive. The structures and the camp site are equipped to provide the elimination of fallout dust in a short time so as to bring the total exposure of the evacuees to radioactivity levels low enough to be safe, until the radioactivity within miles has decayed down to levels acceptable for long time exposure. The sheltering structures are interlinked to provide a quasi normal indoor way of life during the period of necessary confinement of the evacuees, so that no evacuee feels the urge to leave the protection provided within the compound against the surrounding grounds radioactivity. The compound configuration is set up to provide the maximum effectiveness for defense against any marauding gangs, until protection can be secured from the police authorities in charge. The size and the implementation for autonomous survival of the camp site are such that no support from the outside world is required for a period of up to several weeks. The overall camp site set up is also such that peacetime and economical use of the camp facilities and amenities can be made, when it is not utilized as survival camp, which, of course, is the most fervent hope of everyone.","Classifications

The invention relates to light water reactor designs in which thorium is used as fuel and in particular to designs of jacketless fuel assemblies, which make up the cores of pressurized water reactors (PWRs) such as the VVER-1000. Nuclear reactor cores containing seed and blanket subassemblies that make up the fuel assemblies are used to burn thorium fuel together with conventional reactor fuel that includes nonproliferative enriched uranium, as well as weapons-grade and reactor-grade plutonium. In the first alternative, the reactor core is fully “nonproliferative,” since neither the reactor fuel nor the wastes generated can be used to produce nuclear weapons. In the second version of the invention, the reactor core is used to burn large amounts of weapons-grade plutonium together with thorium and provides a suitable means to destroy stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium and convert the energy released to electric power. The cores in both embodiments of the invention are made up of a set of seed-blanket assemblies, which have central seed areas surrounded by annular blanket areas. The seed areas contain uranium or plutonium fuel rods, while the blanket areas contain thorium fuel rods. The volume ratio of moderator to fuel and the relative sizes of the seed area and the blanket area have been optimized so that neither embodiment of the invention generates wastes that can be used to produced nuclear weapons. A new refueling system is also used for the first embodiment of the invention to maximize recycling of the seed fuel; the system also ensures that the spent nuclear fuel cannot be used to produce nuclear weapons.","Classifications

Inositol hexaphosphate (IP-6) is a polyphosphorylated carbohydrate with potent antioxidant activity to prevent active oxygen species-mediated mutagenesis, cell injury and carcinogenesis. IP-6 also activates DNA repair mechanisms. Sublethal radiation causes DNA damage through the formation of free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and pyrimidine crosslinks leading to cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In the skin it results in the induction of skin cancer, premature skin aging, immuno-suppression, inflammation, and cell death. Likewise sublethal exposure to ionizing radiation as in nuclear blasts (war-time, accidental, terrorist-induced etc), cosmic radiation, etc. also causes the same spectrum of damage to the cells and the organisms with acute symptoms and eventual high risk of many cancers. IP-6 and/or inositol and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, including pyrophosphates and citrate derivatives, significantly counteract the harmful effects of radiation, affecting cell cycle progression in a protective manner (more cells in the protective GI phase) as well as decreasing apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Various salts of IP-6 are used with comparable efficacy and the combination of IP-6+inositol affords the best protection against radiation-induced cell injury.

"Nuclear fusion power plant having a liquid reactor core of molten glass that is made laseractive and functions as a tritium breeding blanket which is capable of acousticly compressing/confining fuel so that it radiates and triggers outgoing laser cascades that will reflect from the blast chamber's spherical inside wall and return like photonic Tsunamis, crushing, heating, and causing thermonuclear ignition of the fuel so that heat engines and piezoelectric harvesters can convert the released energy into electricity",US20120014491A1,"
A nuclear fusion power plant having a spherical blast-chamber filled with a liquid coolant that breeds tritium, absorbs neutrons, and functions as both an acoustical and laser medium. Fuel bubbles up through the sphere's base and is positioned using computer guided piezoelectric transducers that are located outside the blast-chamber. These generate phase-shifted standing-waves that tractor the bubble to the center. Once there, powerful acoustic compression waves are launched. Shortly before these reach the fuel, an intense burst of light is pumped into the sphere, making the liquid laser-active. When the shockwaves arrive, the fuel temperature skyrockets and it radiates brightly. This, photon-burst, seeds outgoing laser cascades that return, greatly amplified, from the sphere's polished innards. Trapped within a reflecting sphere, squeezed on all sides by high-density matter, the fuel cannot cool or disassemble before thorough combustion. The blast's kinetic energy is absorbed piezoelectrically.","Classifications

Destruction of plutonium,US5513226A,"
Plutonium is effectively and economically rendered unsuitable for employment in a device for creating a nuclear detonation. Weapons-grade plutonium is made into ceramic fuel in the form of spheroids of submillimeter size, coated with multi-layer fission-product-retentive coatings and disposed in sealed fuel chambers in graphite block fuel elements. These elements are used to form a core for a modular helium-cooled high temperature nuclear reactor which is operated to efficiently generate power by causing the hot high pressure helium coolant to drive a gas turbine directly connected to an electrical generator, which nuclear fuel core has about a 3-year lifetime. Spent nuclear fuel elements are removed at the end of 3 years and shifted to form the core for an accelerator-driven helium-cooled reactor wherein a subcritical core of spent fuel elements is safely caused to effectively continuously fission by a neutron flux created by a Linac which bombards a lead target with a beam of high energy protons. At the end of 1 to 2 more years, more than 99% of the original Pu-239 has fissioned or been transmuted, and the isotope distribution of remaining plutonium renders it no longer useful for carrying out a nuclear detonation. Such fuel elements can be securely stored without reprocessing in simple metal canisters in a long-term repository.","Classifications

Directional thermal neutron detector,US5659177A,"
A directional thermal neutron detector for detecting thermal neutrons and determining the direction of the thermal neutron source. The directional detector includes an array of individual thermal neutron detector modules, each of which comprises front and back planar silicon detectors having a gadolinium foil sandwiched therebetween. The array comprises a plurality of individual detector modules which are angularly displaced with respect to each other. The direction of the thermal neutron source is determined by comparing the magnitudes of the output signals from the plurality of angularly displaced detector modules. Each thermal neutron detector module is segmented into four quadrants to reduce its capacitance and resultant noise. The thickness of the gadolinium foil in each thermal neutron detector module is at least 15 microns thick, to improve the front-to-back silicon detector counting ratio to ascertain the side (front or back) from which thermal neutrons are arriving at the detector. Moreover, the thick gadolinium foil makes each detector module substantially opaque to thermal neutrons, and the detector modules are positioned relative to each other in the array to shield one another from thermal neutrons, thereby enhancing the angular resolution of the directional thermal neutron detector. Gamma rays are discriminated against by using coincidence signal processing within the elements of the detector sandwich to reduce the gamma ray contribution to the total signal.","Classifications

"Method and system for high-speed, 3D imaging of optically-invisible radiation",US6815687B1,"
A high-speed, three-dimensional, gamma-ray imaging method and system as well as a detector and array of such detectors for use therein are provided which characterize radioactivity distributions in nuclear and radioactive waste and materials facilities by superimposing radiation images on a view of the environment using see-through display screens or shields to provide a stereoscopic view of the radiation. The method and system provide real-time visual feedback about the locations and relative strengths of radioactive sources. The method and system dynamically provide continuous updates to the displayed image illustrating changes, such as source movement. A pair of spaced gamma-ray cameras of a detector subsystem function like “gamma eyes”. A pair of CCD cameras may be coupled to the detector subsystem to obtain information about the physical architecture of the environment. A motion tracking subsystem is used to generate information on the user's position and head orientation to determine what a user “sees”. The invention exploits the human brain's ability to naturally reconstruct a 3D, stereoscopic image from 2D images generated by two “imagers” separated by a known angle(s) without the need for 3D mathematical image reconstruction. The method and system are not only tools for minimizing human exposure to radiation thus assisting in ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) planning, but also are helpful for identifying contamination in, for example, laboratory or industrial settings. Other optically-invisible radiation such as infrared radiation caused by smoldering fires may also be imaged. Detectors are manufactured or configured in curvilinear geometries (such as hemispheres, spheres, circles, arcs, or other arrangements) to enable sampling of the ionizing radiation field for determination of positional activity (absolute or relative amounts of ionizing radiation) or spectroscopy (energy distributions of photons). More than one detector system may be used to obtain three-dimensional information. The detector systems are specifically suitable for direct visualization of radiation fields.","Classifications

In-situ groundwater clean-up and radionuclide disposal method,US5679256A,"
A system for remediating groundwater contaminated with radionuclides, consisting of an underground bed of crushed zeolites. Distribution pipes convey contaminated groundwater to the zeolite bed by means of a pump, which draws the contaminated water through wells from an underground plume of released waste mixed with groundwater. The radionuclides in the water undergo ion exchange with the zeolite minerals, and lock into the zeolite crystal lattice. After the contaminated water passes through the zeolite bed, it is collected by a series of collection pipes and conveyed to a sampling station, where it can be determined whether the water has been decontaminated sufficiently to discharge it by piping to a river outfall or back to the ground. When functioning, the system contains the released contaminants on the waste site and prevents further spread and migration of the contaminated water by means of the cone of depression created by the pumping well. When the system is fully charged with radionuclides, burial of the zeolite bed results in a permanent solution to the disposal of the radionuclides in a stable configuration. The radionuclides are locked into the crystal structure of a mineral, below ground but above groundwater level, similar to their condition before being mined.","Classifications

Insitu zeolite filter bed system for the removal of metal contaminants,US5911876A,"
A system for remediating groundwater contaminated with radionuclides, consisting of an underground bed of crushed zeolites. Distribution pipes convey contaminated groundwater to the zeolite bed by means of a pump, which draws the contaminated water through wells from an underground plume of released waste mixed with groundwater. The radionuclides in the water undergo capture with the zeolite minerals, and lock into the zeolite crystal lattice. After the contaminated water passes through the zeolite bed, it is collected by a series of collection pipes and conveyed to a sampling station, where it can be determined whether the water has been decontaminated sufficiently to discharge it by piping to a river outfall or back to the ground. When functioning, the system contains the released contaminants on the waste site and prevents further spread and migration of the contaminated water by means of the cone of depression created by the pumping well. When the system is fully charged with radionuclides, burial of the zeolite bed results in a permanent solution to the disposal of the radionuclides in a stable configuration. The radionuclides are locked into the crystal structure of a mineral, below ground but above groundwater level, similar to their condition before being mined.","Classifications

Virtual reality simulation-based training of telekinegenesis system for training sequential kinematic behavior of automated kinematic machine,US6445964B1,"
To train the sequential kinematic behavior of an automated telekinegenesis robot system, a virtual reality simulator is driven with kinematic parameter data derived from a teleoperational device, which models the sequential behavior to be exhibited by the target robot. Sensor outputs of the teleoperational device are processed by a geometry conversion algorithm, to generate data representative of the spatial kinematics of the robot's desired travel path. A kinematic machine simulator program within a robotic control simulation workstation simulates a virtual machine based upon the actual parameters of the robot. The virtual reality simulation program is interactive, allowing the workstation operator to selectively interrupt the operation of the machine, modify its control parameters, and then rerun the program, until the desired behavior of the target machine is achieved. When the target machine's simulated kinematic behavior produced by the virtual reality simulation workstation exhibits the desired dynamic spatial geometry profile, the customized spatial parameter data stored in the workstation is processed by the virtual reality simulation program, to produce a sequence of kinematic control instructions that are downloaded into the micro controller of the target machine. When executed, the kinematic control instructions cause the robot to exhibit its intended on-line sequential kinematic behavior.","Classifications

Protection against radiant heat energy,US3718592A,"
This invention relates to a process for providing protection against intense radiant heat energy such as that released by a thermonuclear explosion. The process is characterized by disposing a dye in the vapor state between the source of radiant heat energy and an object to be protected. The chromophore groups of the dye intercept photons primarily in the ultra-violet, visible and infra-red regions and reradiate and/or dissipate heat energy to the air thereby decreasing the heat energy reaching the object to be protected. The dyes contemplated by the invention are those that contain chromophore groups defined as molecules or portions thereof capable of intercepting photons and which are stable in the vapor state. In a preferred embodiment, the dye is combined with a carrier which secures the dye to a substrate to be protected and preferably is capable of vaporizing or gassing as opposed to liberating smoke, at least in part, at relatively low temperatures, as required for protection of the substrate, to liberate dye which is vaporized and propelled towards the source of radiant heat energy by the gaseous decomposition products of the carrier.","Classifications

Method for removal of radionuclide contaminants from groundwater,US6531064B1,"
A system for remediating groundwater contaminated with radionuclides, consisting of an underground bed of crushed zeolites. Distribution pipes convey contaminated groundwater to the zeolite bed by means of a pump, which draws the contaminated water through wells from an underground plume of released waste mixed with groundwater. The radionuclides in the water undergo capture with the zeolite minerals and lock into the zeolite crystal lattice. After the contaminated water passes through the zeolite bed, it is collected by a series of collection pipes and conveyed to a sampling station, where it can be determined whether the water has been decontaminated sufficiently to discharge it by piping to a river outfall or back to the ground. When functioning, the system contains the released contaminants on the waste site and prevents further spread and migration of the contaminated water by means of the cone of depression created by the pumping well. When the system is fully charged with radionuclides, burial of the zeolite bed results in a permanent solution to the disposal of the radionuclides in a stable configuration. The radionuclides are locked into the crystal structure of a mineral, below ground, similar to their condition before being mined.","Classifications

Process for neutron interrogation of objects in relative motion or of large extent,US7663119B2,"
The invention relates to the fact that a common industrial neutron interrogation screening requirement is that a high throughput rate be accommodated by the screening system. The accumulation of elemental abundance ratio spectral data to minimize statistical uncertainty is a function of the neutron flux passing through the subject. If the subject passes through a neutron beam, with a strictly limited time window for exposure, the flux must be sufficient to accumulate the required statistics.

Automatic response building defense system and method,US6293861B1,"
A building protection system and method is provided which is responsive to the release of hazardous agents both outside and inside of a protected building. For an outside release, an array of sensors surrounding the perimeter of the building is triggered to provide and indication that an external release has occurred. These external sensors operate in real time and are set at relatively high thresholds to prevent false positives. Upon initial detection of a release in a concentration above the threshold level of a perimeter sensor, a central processor connected to receive a release signal from the sensor will shut down all external air exchanges for the building and activate an over-pressure system for the building interior to insure that contaminated external air does not enter. Exterior sampling inlets are monitored to determine if high agent concentrations exist as a confirmation of the indication given by the perimeter sensors. Should an internal attack occur in the entrance area, or other internal area of a protected building, an internal sensor system will cause the central processor to close off the affected area, and activate the over-pressure system to pressurize unaffected areas. Sampling inlets connected in various areas within the building will monitor these areas to determine if they have been contaminated and the concentration and type of contaminating agent. The processor can activate a decontaminant spray system to decontaminate the contaminated areas.","Classifications

High energy coaxial cable for use in pulsed high energy systems,US5304739A,"
Commercially available coaxial cables have been used successfully in single shot electromagnetic launcher and other pulsed power applications. The use of a coaxial cable interface between power source and pulsed power load reduces external magnetic fields and also aids in standardizing the interface, enhancing inter-changeability between a variety of power supplies and loads. As pulsed power systems continue to become more energetic and as the importance of repetitive operation increases, the use of commercially available cables becomes impractical because of the large number required for appropriate energy transfer. The cable according to the invention overcomes many problems encountered in the use of conventional cables. It incorporates a large area, flexible conductor in both the current feed and current return path, and matches these conductor cross-sections to provide uniform current paths. It also incorporates high temperature PFA TEFLON insulation capable of operating at 260 degrees C, and uses a high strength woven fiber cover to resist intense forces produced by internal currents and magnetic fields. A standardized, uniform dimension, nonarcing interface termination is also provided. The combination of components and materials easily allows this cable to be used to replace more than six conventional cables.","Classifications

The aerosol forms a thin coating of encapsulant over the hazardous material thereby allowing the hazardous material to be safely removed from the process area or permanently adhered to the walls of the process area. If a chemically hazardous material is found in the process area, a capture liquid can be selected to neutralize the hazardous material. The process is especially effective at recovering radioactive dust from a contaminated process area.","Classifications

Radiant electric heaters,US5043559A,"
A radiant electric heater (10) has two coiled resistance wire heating elements (22,24) each connected to one terminal (N) of a power supply via respective rectifiers. These rectifiers are each made up of two like-poled arms of a bridge rectifier (34) connected in parallel, and they are arranged to allow current through one heating element (22) on positive-going half-cycles of the power supply waveform, and through the other heating element (24) on negative-going half-cycles. The elements are rated for continuous power dissipation under these circumstances. A PTC thermistor (36) is connected between the ends of the heating elements connected to the rectifiers. Optionally an NTC thermistor (40) can be connected in series with the PTC thermistor.
Upon initial energization the PTC thermistor is a near short-circuit, so current flows through both heating elements on both polarity half-cycles, dissipating twice their rated power. The elements increase in temperature more quickly than if they were initially energized at only their rated power, so the visible response of the elements to energization is faster. Meanwhile the PTC thermistor increases in resistance owing to self-heating, thereby removing the short-circuit after a few seconds, reducing the power dissipation in the elements to its normal level and protecting them from excessive operating temperatures.","Classifications

Capacitive position sensor,US20090115431A1,"
A capacitive touch sensor is provided having sensing path for setting a color parameter to a desired value within a range, the color parameter being color hue, color saturation or color temperature. The sensor has a first mode of operation in which a parameter can be set approximately to a desired value and a second mode in which the value can be refined to the exact amount. In the first mode, the full range of possible values is mapped onto the sensing path and a user touch selects a value within the full range according to its position along the sensing path. In the second mode a finer adjustment is provided for, either by mapping a narrower sub-range of the full range onto the sensing path, or by allowing incremental adjustment of the parameter from the value initially set in the first mode, each incremental unit of adjustment being triggered by the object being displaced through a pre-determined threshold displacement along the sensing path. Switching from the first mode to the second mode is triggered if moving displacement of the object along the sensing path from the first point of touch exceeds a minimum threshold value. This provides an intuitive transition for the user from coarse to fine adjustment.","Classifications

Producing liquid organic fertilizer from organic substrates,US7771504B1,"
The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for the production of organic liquid fertilizer from waste using a two-phase process. The first phase comprises a successive extraction process whereby liquid leachate is drained from one plant or storage container and the process subsequently re-started with new fresh water. The second phase comprises an accelerated bio-leaching process wherein plant material is stored in a solid bed similar to a batch process, and a leachate (e.g., water and bacteria) is re-circulated through the solid bed until the process of hydrolysis and acidification results in dissolution of organic material into the re-circulating leachate. The leachate is thus concentrated without losing the nutrient and is subsequently used as an organic fertilizer.","Classifications

Pure organic fertilizer,US6517600B1,"
A process for converting composted organic material produced by optimized composting procedures into pure organic fertilizer for agronomic and other uses, particularly the expanding organic food market. It is essential that only organic wastes that are compatible with being certified organic are used for the composting step. In the first step, the raw organic matter is processed into compost by optimized standard methods, and is screened to remove all particles approximately 1 cm in size or greater. This coarse material is recycled back into the composting process. In the second step, the material below 1 cm is further screened to separate out the compost fine particles of 1 mm or less. A major proportion of the particles should be below 150 microns. The particles between 1 mm and 1 cm are rejected, and may be used for other purposes. In the third step, the compost fine particles are pelleted at a pressure between 2,000 and 6,000 psi to form a pure organic fertilizer pellet of an appropriate density so that the nutrients will be released into a soil medium, or plant substrate, at a rate required for optimum plant growth. The compression process binds the fine particles together, and assists in the timed release of the nutrients from the pure organic fertilizer pellet. The pure organic fertilizer pellets can be applied to organic farm fields, market gardens, and the like, in the normal way.","Classifications

This invention pertains to a composition, which is a natural and organic pesticide, specifically for mitigating, controlling and treating fungicidal, virucidal and bactericidal pathogenic microorganisms in agricultural products such as root crops, fruits and vegetables. Examples of such disease-causing microorganisms are Mycosphaerella fijensis causing black Sigatoka disease in Cavendish (banana), Ralstonia solanacearum causing Moko disease in Cavendish (banana), Lasiodiplodia theobromae causing soft rot or fruit rot in crops and fruits, Fusarium oxysporum causing Panama wilt in fruits and crops, and many others. The composition is a fermented product of tropical plants, carbon source, protein (nitrogen) source, and a carrier agent. The fermented product may help strengthen the plant's immune system to fight pathogenic diseases. Since all the major constituents of the composition are generally regarded as safe, this natural pesticide is found to be non-toxic and safe to humans and animals, and environmentally benign.","Classifications

Subtracted from the site-specific amounts of nutrient needed are site-specific amounts of the nutrient currently existing in the field, thus producing the map of site-specific nutrient amounts to be added. The nutrient amounts may be added to the soil using the map and conventional variable-rate fertilizer application methods. In one embodiment, the amounts of the soil nutrient needed to produce the maximum possible yield at each site is created using a map of site-specific measures of biomass produced by the field in a past growing season or seasons, which in turn is created from a remotely sensed biomass image.","Classifications

"System for cultivation and processing of microorganisms, processing of products therefrom, and processing in drillhole reactors",US8715980B2,"
Described are methods of cultivating autotrophic microorganisms, particularly microalgae or diatoms, in a bioreactor by entraining a culture of the microorganisms in a tenuous, gelated, thixotrophic carrier medium having nutrients therefor and moving the medium along a passage at a sufficiently slow speed to enable laminar flow which in cross section is closed and which has transparent walls through which the culture is irradiated to enable photosynthesis. The method includes effecting convective turnover of the culture and medium as they flow along the passage by differentially heating the medium laterally relative to the flow direction so as to produce a generally helical flow of the culture and medium. Also described are processing methods, both physical and chemical, performed underground e.g. in drillholes, to utilize decavitation energy under ambient elevated pressures, including processes to implement lysis of the micro-organisms, producing methanol, syngas synthesis, Haber ammonia synthesis, Fischer-Tropsch reactions, supercritical reactions, dimethyl ether synthesis, and nitric acid synthesis.","Classifications

In a liquid treating process according to the present invention, colloidal particles in stable hydrated states or in meta-stable hydrophobic colloidal states in a liquid are rendered hydrophobic and separated from liquid molecules by an electric field formed by a microwave. The separated colloidal particles are allowed to collide against one another to become flocculated under a cavitation effect by a ultrasonic wave having a frequency in a low frequency range, and the liquid is deodorized by an electromagnetic ultrasonic wave having a frequency in a high frequency range. Therefore, it is possible to easily and reliably remove the colloidal particles dissolved in the liquid and to deodorize the liquid without need for a large-scaled equipment. For this purpose, the microwave which is an electromagnetic wave is emitted to the liquid containing the colloidal particles of water-soluble organic substances, microorganisms and the like to separate the colloidal particles from the liquid molecules and then, a ultrasonic wave having a frequency in a low frequency range is emitted to the liquid resulting from the separation of the colloidal particles to flocculate the colloidal particles, and an electromagnetic ultrasonic wave having a frequency in a high frequency range is emitted to the liquid to deodorize the liquid.","Classifications

Depositing and Farming Methods for Drying Oil Sand Mature Fine Tailings,US20130081298A1,"
Methods for drying oil sand fine tailings treated to comprise flocculated fine tailings, by deposition and farming techniques, are provided. A deposition cell is provided with a sloped bottom surface and the flocculated fine tailings are deposited to undergo channelless advancement in the cell while allowing drainage of release water. When the deposit is uneven, the deposit may be plowed while wet for spreading and ensuring water release conditioning is imparted thereto, while avoiding over-shearing, and maintaining sufficient shear strength to allow standing. Once a dried upper crust forms, the deposit may be harrowed to break up the crust, expose wet regions there-beneath and create furrows in the standing deposit. The methods improve the dewatering and drying of mature fine tailings in oil sands.","Classifications

Method for water purification by culturing and harvesting attached algal communities,US5846423A,"
A method for purifying water includes the steps of establishing a floway for water that has originated in a waterway. The sides of the floway are bounded by a pair of curbs that are disposed in a spaced-apart, parallel relationship. The floway has an inlet end and an outlet end disposed lower than the inlet, so that gravity flow occurs toward the outlet end. An algal growing surface is established between the curbs, so that algae can grow and form a turf. A periodic surge of water is caused to flow along at least part of the floway, which permits bioassimilation of nutrients and pollutants by the algal turf, and also permits a physical trapping of particulates therein. The algal turf is harvested after maturation and is disposed of without permitting the algal turf to reenter the waterway. Harvesting may be accomplished for example, with the use of a wheeled harvester disposed to roll along the curbs.","Classifications

Packaged virus-like particles for use as adjuvants: method of preparation and use,US20040005338A1,"
The invention relates to the finding that virus like particles (VLPs) can be loaded and packaged, respectively, with DNA oligonucleotides rich in non-methylated C and G (CpGs). If such CpG-VLPs are mixed with antigens, the immunogenicity of these antigens are dramatically enhanced. In addition, the T cell responses against the antigens are especially directed to the Th1 type. Surprisingly, no covalent linkage of the antigen to the VLP is required; it is sufficient to simply mix the VLPs with the adjuvants for co-administration. In addition, it was found that VLPs did not enhance immune responses unless they were loaded and packaged, respectively, with CpGs. Antigens mixed with CpG-packaged VLPs may therefore be ideal vaccines for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination against allergies, tumors and other self-molecules and chronic viral diseases.","Classifications

Apparatus and method of detecting ground fault of solar power generation system,US6930868B2,"
In a solar power generation system which causes a non-insulated type inverter to convert DC power generated by a solar battery into AC power and outputs the AC power to a commercial power system, in detecting a ground fault, the differential current between the output lines of the solar battery is detected, an AC leakage current component due to the capacitance to ground of the solar battery is removed from the differential current, and it is determined whether a ground fault state has occurred by comparing a current value after removal of the AC leakage current component with a predetermined threshold value. With this arrangement, a false ground fault state determination that is caused by the influence of the AC leakage current component due to the electrostatic capacitance although the DC current path can be prevented, and a ground fault state can accurately be determined.","Classifications

The electrical energy is thereby converted and stored in the resulting magnetic field. This magnetic energy is extracted by drawing off the current at very high rates and used to energize a laser or microwave generator for wireless power transmission. Since the discharge of the superconducting coil can proceed at rates many times greater than the charging rate, the resulting beamed power can, over short time intervals, be many times greater than the rate of solar radiation falling on the solar array.

A further embodiment can additionally exhibit hysteresis at load turn-off so that the load does not cycle on and off and can further raise the load turn-off threshold above the level where the battery is substantially discharged, thereby hastening recharging of the battery. A still further embodiment provides temperature compensation for improved performance.","Classifications

Inflatable fresnel lens solar concentrator for space power,US6111190A,"
A novel, high-efficiency, extremely light-weight, inflatable refractive solar concentrator for space power is described. It consists of a flexible Fresnel lens, flexible sides, and a back surface, together enclosing a volume of space which can be filled with low pressure gas to deploy the concentrator on orbit. The back surface supports the energy receiver/converter located in the focal region of the Fresnel lens. The back surface can also serve as the waste heat radiator. Prior to deployment, the deflated flexible lens and sides are folded against the back surface to form a flat, low-volume package for efficient launch into space. The inflatable concentrator can be configured to provide either a line focus or a point focus of sunlight. The new inflatable concentrator approach will provide significant advantages over the prior art in two different space power areas: photovoltaic concentrator arrays and high-temperature solar thermal conversion systems. Photovoltaic concentrator arrays using the new inflatable lens will be much lighter than prior space concentrator arrays. In addition, for photovoltaic concentrator arrays, the new inflatable lens will eliminate the need for a fragile glass superstrate to support the lens, substantially improving robustness of the lens. Solar thermal concentrator arrays using the new inflatable lens will be much lighter than prior art space concentrators which used parabolic mirrors. In addition, for solar thermal applications in space, the new inflatable lens will eliminate the need for high surface accuracy, which has been a significant problem for prior art concentrators.","Classifications

Converging lens-heat sink panels which do similar job as that of reflector-heat sink panels are also described.

Evapotranspiration remote irrigation control system,US5870302A,"
A system and method for using evapotranspiration (ET) and/or predicted precipitation data in controlling automated and semi-automated irrigation systems. In accordance with the present invention, meteorological data is monitored and used to adjust watering schedules for an irrigation site. A central computer uses the meteorological data and ET data to compute a watering factor. The watering factor represents the difference between a reference watering schedule (which can be stored at the irrigation site) and a new watering schedule. The new watering schedule can be based on similar climatic conditions of a geographic area in which the irrigation site is located. The watering factor is then sent to the irrigation site, which uses the watering factor to modify the reference watering schedule, if appropriate. Alternatively, meteorological data and site characteristics can be monitored at the irrigation site and sent to the central computer, which then computes the watering factor based on this specific site information. The computed ET data is preferably based on a current prediction of future events based upon present meteorological conditions. The system and method of the present invention achieves a substantial savings in water usage.","Classifications

Flexible tube having a tapered diameter portion for use with endoscopic irrigation instruments,US5549547A,"
An endoscopic irrigation instrument includes a fluid chamber, a cannula coupled to a distal end of the fluid chamber, a tapered irrigation tube which couples at its proximal end to a fluid source and which couples at its distal end to an irrigation port of the fluid chamber, and a pinch valve which controls the flow of fluid from the irrigation source to the fluid chamber and hence through the cannula to the surgical site. The tapered irrigation tube is arranged so that it has a first relatively larger constant inner diameter and relatively larger wall thickness on its proximal end until it tapers down in both inner diameter and wall thickness at a location slightly proximal the pinch valve. By the time the tapered irrigation tube passes the pinch valve in the endoscopic instrument, the tapered irrigation tube is at a second relatively smaller constant inner diameter and a relatively smaller wall thickness. The tapered irrigation tube thus enables greater fluid flow, pinch valve control at the thin distal end, and tube reliability at both high and low fluid pressures.","Classifications

Evapotranspiration forecasting irrigation control system,US5696671A,"
A method and apparatus for using predictive evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation data in controlling automated and semi-automated irrigation systems. In accordance with the present invention, the conventional use of ET values is modified to take into account predicted or forecast weather events. By using forecast weather data in computing ET values, a substantial savings in water use can be achieved. Past or historical meteorological data is used to make corrective adjustments to the watering schedules that have been predicted using meteorological forecasting. That is, as each day becomes past or historical, adjustments to the overall cumulative depletion of water in the soil need to be made. When an irrigation site is to be updated with a new watering schedule, actual meteorological data is first used to correct any differences between the previously forecast and actual meteorological data to the current day. After past cumulative depletion has been determined, future predictions of precipitation and ET values are used to determine when and how much to water. Future meteorological data predictions can be updated or modified as new data becomes available, thereby allowing closer matching of predicted ET values with actual ET values. Modifying meteorological data on a daily basis results in predictions that more closely follow actual ET values than updating on a weekly or longer schedule.","Classifications

"Methods and apparatus for reducing tracheal infection using subglottic irrigation, drainage and servoregulation of endotracheal tube cuff pressure",US5582167A,"
An integrated system providing a mechanical and chemical barrier against the spread of infected secretions into the distal trachea is disclosed. An endotracheal tube used for patient airway management and provides a means to conveniently irrigate and drain the subglottic region below the vocal cords and above an inflated cuff. The subglottic region accumulates liquid secretions that may channel past an inflated endotracheal tube cuff, providing the necessary bacterial inoculum leading to bronchitis and nosocomial pneumonia. An irrigation channel delivers liquids such as saline or antibiotic and antifungal medications for mucosal hydration, and bactericidal action against infected subglottic secretions. An outer sleeve surrounding the endotracheal tube forms a suction lumen for removing the secretions. The tapered and compliant nature of this sleeve at body temperature allows a large suction channel without the need to greatly enlarge the outside diameter of the endotracheal tube at the vocal cord level. Electronic and mechanical controls provide regulated volume infusion and regulated suction. In addition, cuff pressure is servoregulated to the lowest pressure that provides a tracheal seal and rapid adjustment of cuff pressure so that peak airway pressures are attenuated, thus preserving mucosal perfusion. Pneumonia and patient mortality are thus prevented.","Classifications

Irrigation control and management system,US5479339A,"
A system and method for providing cooperative control of irrigation between a groundskeeper having immediate supervision on plants to be irrigated and management personnel remotely located by using weather data and water budget restrictions. The system implements a method that involves responding to a signal from an atmometer that a predetermined ""threshold"" amount of water has been lost to evapotranspiration at or near an irrigation station. A daily total of these threshold signals are stored in a weather table for use in automatically determining a quantity of water that has been lost to evapotranspiration at the station since the most recent irrigation. The determined quantity is automatically combined with an evapotranspiration factor in order to determine how much water to replace. Alternatively, current data received from a remote site may used by the machine executed means to override the weather data table. An automatic check is performed to determine if the amount scheduled for application will exceed a predetermined budget based on historical weather data. If the budget is to be exceeded, an alert is sent via an attached display to an operator. The operator may use a keypad to instruct control logic to perform corrective action. If no corrective action is taken, then a ""budget noncompliance"" report is recorded in permanent storage for review by management personnel.","Classifications

Urinary catheter and bladder irrigation system,US5300022A,"
An improvement over the Foley catheter which provides, in addition to the main drainage lumen, a central smaller lumen for continuous delivery of a small quantity of sterile irrigating solution directly through the distal tip into the bladder. A larger portion of the irrigating solution is deflected by the cone shaped roof of the distal tip and turned backward past the drainage ports and into the drainage lumen. This backward flow of liquid causes a mild suction which assists the removal of clots and tissue debris from the bladder. The continuous flow of sterile solution also cleanses the drainage lumen and prevents the upward movement of bacteria common in most urinary catheters. A suction syringe can also be used in the usual manner in the event of a blockage. A second embodiment of the invention provides two protuberances across from the drainage ports within the distal tip to assist in breaking up clots as they enter the drainage lumen.","Classifications

The portable data shuttle is coupled to an irrigation controller and a first watering schedule is downloaded from the portable data shuttle into the irrigation controller in a matter of seconds. At a later time, the data shuttle automatically downloads a second watering schedule replacing the first schedule, thereby updating the irrigation programming. For example, a new watering schedule may be automatically downloaded at preselected intervals to accommodate the changing seasons. The portable data shuttle includes voltage regulation circuits so that it can receive power from either the personal computer or the irrigation controller. The invention avoids the time consuming task of programming and re-programming an irrigation controller directly. Where numerous controllers are involved, the invention allows each to be programmed and reprogrammed in a matter of seconds instead of the usual ten to fifteen minutes per controller.","Classifications

Irrigation controller water management with temperature budgeting,US7266428B2,"
The present invention provides methods for water conservation with AC, DC, or ambient light powered irrigation controllers without the use of complex ET (evapotranspiration) data or ET related service fees. Programming may consist of the operator entering a preliminary irrigation schedule, and entering the local zip code. The controller then periodically calculates a water budget by comparing current (non ET) local geo-environmental data with stored local geo-environmental data, and then modifies the preliminary schedule using the water budget. A number of embodiments are possible: stand-alone controllers with a temperature sensor attached directly to the microprocessor within that controller, or as a centrally placed CBM (Central Broadcast Module) which calculates a water budget percentage which is transmitted to one or more field controllers by wired or wireless means. Alternately, a TBM (Temperature Budget Module) that is separate from the controller is connected between the controller outputs and the valves, or mounted at the valves themselves. The TBM periodically calculates the ,water budget, monitors the controller outputs and adjusts the irrigation schedule based upon the water budget ratio. Because of its flexible capabilities with AC, DC, solar, or ambient light powered controllers, as a centrally broadcast water budget ratio in a wired or wireless configuration, or as an add-on to existing controllers or valves, its programming simplicity and close approximation to ET without its complications and cost, the present invention has the potential to save more water and minimize runoff than currently available ET methods.","Classifications

Automatic irrigation water conservation controller,US4922433A,"
A water conservation system that connects between a standard irrigation system that is controlled by a clock, and the water control valves of that system in order to limit the flow of water during timed irrigation cycles. When the timed watering cycles are initiated by the standard irrigation system, the water conservation device senses the moisture in the soil and compares it with preset wet and dry moisture limits and scales back each of the watering cycles in proportion to the moisture content of the ground to thereby conserve irrigation water that is applied to a ground area. The device includes a moisture sensor, a central processing unit, and a solid state memory that is connected to the central processing unit and the moisture sensor. When the device of the invention is initialized, the solid state memory samples and records the wet and dry moisture readings of the ground zone and stores the resultant wet and dry readings in the memory so that each time the timed irrigation system cycles, the water conservation device senses the moisture compares it with the wet and dry readings and scales back the amount of water applied to the ground area.","Classifications

Domestic watering and agricultural irrigation control system,US5465904A,"
An improved watering/irrigation control system for use in conjunction with automatic domestic lawn and plant watering systems and/or automatic agricultural irrigation systems that utilizes historical rainfall data and/or predictive rainfall data or restrictive watering data for a determination of when standard timed periodic irrigation or watering operations should be interrupted or withheld given the existence of sufficient rainfall already on the ground or a sufficient likelihood that such rainfall will occur within a predetermined period of time such that the normal watering or irrigation cycle is made unnecessary. The invention utilizes a coded signal transmitted from a centralized location or through common carriers; such as, cable, telephone, paging services, or radio and television broadcast that is received and interpreted by a local unit and utilized to provide predictive rainfall or restrictive watering information to a processor that activates or deactivates the standard timed watering or irrigation cycle. Such predictive rainfall or restrictive watering information may be used alone in a system or is combined with or supplements historical rainfall data in a manner that provides a more efficient watering or irrigation cycle and creates fewer watering cycles that end up being unnecessary in view of concurrent rainfall.

"Irrigation flow converter, monitoring system and intelligent water management system",US7930069B2,"
The present invention is directed to an intelligent water management irrigation system for monitoring the total water usage for a billing site and preventing cumulative water usage from exceeding a water budget by adjusting the amount of water used for irrigation. Irrigation zone priority values are selected for each irrigation zone that specify a percentage of the full water need that the foliage in the zone can survive and are saved in an intelligent water management irrigation (IWMI) controller. The IWMI controller receives water usage information originating from a property's water meter and compares the measured water usage with the allowable water budget. Water usage is tracked separately for the household use and landscape use (irrigation). Prior to each irrigation cycle, the IWMI controller estimates the amount of water that will be needed by the landscape and for household use during the remainder of a billing cycle; household use is given precedence over landscape use. If the water budget will support both, irrigation can proceed normally. If the budget will not support both, the IWMI controller estimates the amount of water needed for the remainder of the billing cycle if only a priority watering amount is allocated for each landscape zone. If the water budget will support priority irrigation, landscape watering can proceed in priority irrigation mode. If the water budget will not support priority irrigation watering, the irrigation cycle is skipped and the water usage estimations are recalculated prior to the next irrigation cycle.","Classifications

Irrigation sprinkler with pivoting throttle valve,US6241158B1,"
A pop-up rotor type irrigation sprinkler has a pivotable butterfly valve body located in its riser just below the nozzle. The valve body is selectively pivotable between fully open and fully closed positions by manually turning a drive member mounted in the upper end of the riser with a hand tool. The drive member is connected to the valve body with a linkage that extends within the riser outside of the water flow path to avoid adversely affecting the water stream ejected from the nozzle. The valve body has an elliptical shape and is curved in section and downwardly concave when in its closed position. Due to its curved shape, the valve body can pivot to its vertical open position in which it rests parallel with the curved cylindrical interior wall of an internal flow tube to minimize flow resistance. Due to its elliptical shape, the valve body can pivot to its substantially horizontal position in which its peripheral edges are snug up against the cylindrical interior wall of an internal flow tube in order to achieve a substantial seal. Tolerance problems that would otherwise be associated with a circular butterfly valve are avoided. The downwardly concave shape of the valve body when in its closed position and its over-the-center pivotal mounting result in the water pressure acting to hold the valve body in its filly closed position until manually pivoted to its open position.","Classifications

Debris tolerant inlet control valve for an irrigation sprinkler,US6186413B1,"
An improved inlet control valve is provided for controlling water inflow to an irrigation sprinkler, wherein the inlet control valve exhibits improved tolerance to passage of small grit and debris. The inlet control valve includes a valve member normally engaging a valve seat to prevent water inflow to the irrigation sprinkler, and adapted for movement to a modulated open position to permit water inflow to the sprinkler at a regulated pressure. The valve member carries a flow restrictor disposed upstream from the valve seat to produce, when the valve member is in the open position, a first pressure drop which cooperates with a second pressure drop between the valve seat and valve member to regulate the water inflow pressure. The inclusion of the upstream flow restrictor and the associated first pressure drop effectively reduces the magnitude of the second pressure drop across the valve seat and thereby permits the valve member to open with an increased clearance relative to the valve seat. Such increased clearance enhances flush flow passage of grit and debris past the valve seat, with reduced risk of particulate entrapment between the valve member and valve seat.","Classifications

A trephination and irrigation set includes a drill guiding soft tissue protector sleeve, a trephination instrument (e.g., a drill) having a length longer than the protector sleeve, a guide rod dimensioned to fit into a trephine hole for preserving the hole through a soft tissue incision, and a tapered cannula sized to lodge in the frontal bone of the skull for introducing irrigation fluid through the cannula and into the frontal sinus cavity. The frontal sinus is treated through a hole drilled through the frontal bone. A small incision is made large enough to accept the soft tissue sleeve protector which is then inserted into the incision and depressed against the bony surface. The sleeve protector has teeth at its periosteal (or distal) edge for gripping the bone securely. The surgeon inserts the drill into the sleeve protector and drills straight through the front table. Once the drill is in the frontal cavity, the sleeve is used to maintain the position of the trephine hole while the drill is withdrawn, whereupon the sleeve remains in place while the guide pin is inserted into the trephine hole. After the guide pin is inserted through the trephine hole, the surgeon removes the soft tissue protector sleeve and the guide pin remains in place to axially guide the irrigation cannula onto sealing engagement with the trephine hole. The tapered irrigation cannula is sized to be retained within the bony trephine hole in the frontal bone and is configured to avoid falling into the sinus. The guide pin is then removed and an I.V. tube is fitted to the cannula proximal end for irrigation or aspiration.","Classifications

Peak power energy storage device and gravitational wave generator,US6160336A,"
An energy storage device comprising a large scale flywheel supported by a fluid bearing. The energy storage device is a very large scale structure having a flywheel of a diameter greater than 100 feet and a concrete steel reinforced rim weighing in excess of 1000 metric tons. In off peak periods the apparatus is operated as a motor with energy input causing the rim to rotate up to a predetermined speed and to maintain rotation at that speed in the power take off mode during peak power time periods, the operation of the electrical circuitry is reversed and the flywheel generates electrical energy which is delivered by the storage device to the power grid. As energy is delivered the rotational speed of the flywheel diminishes and gravitational waves capable of being shaped and modulated are generated. Likewise as energy is added to the device the rotational speed of the flywheel increases and again gravitational waves capable of being shaped and modulated are generated. Such gravitational waves can be utilized for communication, propulsion and for the purpose of testing new physical theories, concepts, and conjectures. A unique electrical circuit utilizing coils and power transistors under computer software control facilitates the functioning of the apparatus as a peak power energy storage device, as an energy supply device obtaining energy directly from the wind or as a gravitational-wave generating device.","Classifications

Gradiometer based terrain estimation,US5402340A,"
A terrain estimation system and procedure in which prior knowledge of terrain configuration is taken as a starting point in the estimation procedure. The gravity field of the earth is sensed by a gradiometer which measures the gravity gradient as the gradiometer is transported by a moving platform past the earth's surface to obtain data of the topology of the earth's surface and of the geology of the terrain including subterranean oil and iron deposits. Optimal filter means, operative in response to a statistical model of terrain and residual geology predict values of gravity gradient to be sensed by said gradiometer at successive locations along a path of travel. Comparison is made between measured and predicted values of gravity gradient to update terrain altitude data by nulling a difference between measured values and predicted values of gravity gradient. Terrain surface is represented by the sum of a finite series of shells developed as cross covariance terms in a statistical mathematical model of terrain and residual geology. Each shell has a three-dimensional surface. A point on the surface of a shell is described by three parameters, namely the height of the point above a reference surface, north slope and east slope. A summation of shells of differing spatial frequency, such as a series of approximately one half dozen shells, provides for a smooth surface which represents the terrain at each of many points on the earth's surface.","Classifications

The invention is a neutral atom (and/or molecule) matter-wave interferometer (and/or set of interferometers) that can be used as an inertial sensor with a sensitivity exceeding that of conventional mechanical sensors and multiple circuit optical interferometers (including ring lasers) by many powers of ten. An interferometer in which matter-wave propagation beam paths enclose a finite area will sense rotations via the Sagnac effect. One with the paths displaced from each other will sense acceleration plus gravity. Interferometers with paths that follow a figure-eight pattern yield a gravitational gradiometer. Laser cooling and slowing of a beam of neutral atoms provides a low energy nearly monochromatic source. Diffraction gratings are employed as beam splitters. Such gratings may consist of apertures in a sheet of solid material, near-resonant standing-wave laser beams, or crystal faces. Path curvature due to acceleration and rotation is canceled by magnetic and/or electric field gradients that produce an effective levitation of slow atoms. A feedback system that maintains an interferometer phase null is employed with its error signal yielding the inertial effect signals. Magnetic and/or electric fields are used for producing matter-wave phase shifts. The invention may be used to measure acceleration, rotation, position, orientation, gravity, the mass distribution of nearby matter, and an electric current. Other important applications are mass tomography, geodesy, and petroleum exploration.","Classifications

Computer-aided image analysis,US6996549B2,"
Digitized image data are input into a processor where a detection component identifies the areas (objects) of particular interest in the image and, by segmentation, separates those objects from the background. A feature extraction component formulates numerical values relevant to the classification task from the segmented objects. Results of the preceding analysis steps are input into a trained learning machine classifier which produces an output which may consist of an index discriminating between two possible diagnoses, or some other output in the desired output format. In one embodiment, digitized image data are input into a plurality of subsystems, each subsystem having one or more support vector machines. Pre-processing may include the use of known transformations which facilitate extraction of the useful data. Each subsystem analyzes the data relevant to a different feature or characteristic found within the image. Once each subsystem completes its analysis and classification, the output for all subsystems is input into an overall support vector machine analyzer which combines the data to make a diagnosis, decision or other action which utilizes the knowledge obtained from the image.","Classifications

An optical switching device comprises: a light guide including a total reflection plane capable of totally reflecting light thereby transmitting the light; a switching part capable of, at a position where its extraction plane is in close contact with the total reflection plane, capturing evanescent light and reflecting the captured light thereby outputting it; and a driving part for driving the optical switching part. The light guide, the switching part, and the driving part are laminated in this order into a multilayer structure. The employment of the multilayer structure makes it possible to optimize the respective layers independently of one another. The extracted light does not pass through the driving part. This allows the driving part to be optimized so as to achieve an optical switching device capable of operating at a high speed with low power consumption. Thus, it is possible to provide a low-loss and high-contrast optical switching device using an evanescent wave, which can respond at a high speed.","Classifications

Gravity gradiometry,US6837106B2,"
A gravity gradiometer is combined with a two-stage actively controlled isolation system. The gravity gradiometer and two stage isolation system may then be mounted within (or on) a mobile vehicle such as, for example, an aircraft. It has been recognized by the inventors herein that the accelerations imparted to an aircraft during normal operations can be separated through system design into two relatively distinct regimes within the frequency domain. The invention provides a first isolation mount, which forms part of the isolation system, to isolate accelerations (and resulting translations) falling within a first of the two frequency regimes. The second isolation mount, which is mounted to the first isolation mount, isolates accelerations falling within the second of the two frequency regimes. A gravity gradiometer can then be mounted to the second isolation mount. As a result of housing the gravity gradiometer within the nested isolation system (a combination of the first and second isolation mounts), the gravity gradiometer is substantially isolated from the accelerations experienced by the mobile vehicle. Consequently, gravity gradients measured by the gravity gradiometer are relatively noise free and provide heretofore-unobtainable accuracy.","Classifications

Moreover, the logic allows the position of one adjustable bed portion to prevent the functioning of the motor for another bed portion. The circuit logic may also preclude the operation of a motor absent the secure engagement of mechanical parts. Further, the logic circuitry permits switches on the selection panel to control one adjustable bed portion, but over different ranges.

Nonlinear constrained inversion method to determine base of salt interface from gravity and gravity tensor data,US6675097B2,"
The present invention is a method for determining a parameter of interest of a region of interest of the earth using tensor data. At least one component of potential fields data is measured at a plurality of locations over a region of interest including a subterranean formation of interest. The potential fields data are selected from magnetic data and gravity data. An initial geophysical model is determined for the region including the subterranean formation of interest. For the model, geophysical tensor data is updated using a forward model at a plurality of locations using an interior method for constrained optimization. A difference between the estimated model value and the measured value of the potential field measurements are determined at the plurality of locations. Based on the this difference the geophysical model is updated. The model is iteratively updated and compared to the measured data until the differences reach an acceptable level and the parameter of interest has been determined.","Classifications

Dual balanced capacitance manometers for suppressing vibration effects,US5396803A,"
A sensor measures an unknown pressure having to a sensitivity on the order of 1 micro-torr. The sensor includes two 10 micro-torr sensitivity capacitance manometers which each receive the unknown pressure. The capacitance manometers are positioned about a common axis around a common pressure chamber that receives the unknown pressure so that the flexible diaphragms of each of the capacitance manometers simultaneously deform either outwardly or inwardly from the common pressure chamber in response to changes in pressure. When a vibrational or gravitational force is applied to the sensor, one flexible diaphragm deforms outwardly away from the common pressure chamber and the other deforms inwardly towards the common pressure chamber. Hence, changes in pressure cause each of the capacitance manometers to produce a like change in their output signal; however, vibrational or gravitational forces produce an opposite change in their output signal. The capacitance manometers are also connected to an electrical circuit which nulls any changes resulting from vibration or gravity, and the electrical circuit is tuneable to account for any variations in the changes due to gravitational forces produced by the capacitance manometers.","Classifications

Two-stage gasification of coal with forced reactant mixing and steam treatment of recycled char,US3782913A,"
A PROCESS FOR THE TWO-STAGE GASIFICATION OF COAL TO PRODUCE METHANE-RICH FUEL GAS. IN THE FIRST STAGE, RECYCLED PROCESSED CHAR PASSES UPWARDLY WHILE REACTING WITH STEAM AND OXYGEN TO YIELD A FIRST STAGE SYNTHESIS GAS CONTAINING HYDROGEN AND OXIDES OF CARBON. IN THE SECOND STAGE, THE SYNTHESIS GAS PASSES UPWARDLY WITH COAL AND STEAM WHICH REACT TO YIELD PARTIALLY GASIFIED CHAR ENTRAINED IN A SECOND STAGE PRODUCT GAS CONTAINING METHANE, HYDROGEN AND OXIDES OF CARBON. THE PRODUCT GAS FROM THE SECOND STAGE IS SEPARATED FROM THE CHAR AND IS PURIFIED BY CONVERSION AND REMOVAL OF CARBON OXIDES, HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND OTHER IMPURITIES, AND THE PURIFIED SECOND STAGE PRODUCT GAS IS METHANATED TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED FUEL GAS. CHAR SEPARATED FROM THE SECOND STAGE PRODUCT GAS IS PASSED THROUGH A FLUIDIZED BED AND SCRUBBED WITH STEAM TO REMOVE PRODUCT GAS AND OTHER VOLATILE MATERIALS WHICH ARE CARRIED BY THE SCRUBBING STEAM TO THE SECOND STAGE PRODUCT GAS CARRIED TO PURIFICATION. THE SCRUBBED RECYCLE CHAR IS CARRIED BY STEAM AT HIGH PRESSURE AND RETURNED TO THE FIRST STAGE. AGGLOMERATION OF COAL IN THE SECOND STAGE IS PREVENTED BY THE RAPID HEATING OF THE COAL TO A TEMPERATURE ABOVE ITS RANGE OF PLASTICITY BY MIXING IT WITH THE HOT PRODUCTS FROM THE FIRST STAGE. IN THE FIRST STAGE THE RATIO OF CHAR AND STEAM TO OXYGEN IS SELECTED TO OBTAIN A REACTION TEMPERATURE ABOVE THE ASH MELTING POINT. THE PRESSURE IN EACH STAGE EXCEEDS 500 P.S.I.G. THE SECOND STAGE TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS 1500*F. AND THE FIRST STAGE TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS 2200*F. GAS VELOCITIES IN BOTH STAGES ARE MAINTAINED BETWEEN 2 AND 12 FEET PER SECOND WHILE THE RESIDENCE TIME OF SOLIDS IN THE FIRST STAGE IS FROM ONEHALF TO FIVE SECONDS AND, IN THE SECOND STAGE, FROM FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS. A MIXING STAGE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND STAGES PROVIDES A RESTRICTED AREA FOR THE INJECTION OF COAL AND STEAM INTO THE UPWARDLY FLOWING SYNTHESIS GAS TO SEPARATE SOLIDS AND GASES ENTERING THE SECOND STAGE FROM THE FIRST STAGE AND TO ASSURE RAPID MIXING AND REACTION OF THE REACTANTS OF BOTH STAGES. SLAG IS REMOVED FROM THE LOWER END OF THE FIRST STAGE FOR QUENCHING AND DISPOSAL THROUGH A SLAG REMOVAL PORT OF SMALL CROSS SECTIONAL AREA COMPARED TO THE CROSS SECTIONAL AREA OF THE FIRST STAGE. THIS ASSURES RESIDENCE AND REACTION TIME OF THE CHAR IN THE FIRST STAGE SUFFICIENT FOR ITS GASIFICATION WITH STEAM AND OXYGEN AT TEMPERATURES ABOVE THE ASH MELTING POINT. THE RELATIVELY SMALL AREA OF THE SLAG REMOVAL PORT PERMITS CONTROLLED REMOVAL OF MOLTEN SLAG WHILE RESTRICTING THE GRAVITATION OF CHAR TO THE SLAG QUENCHING STAGE.

Passive navigation system,US6014103A,"
A Passive Navigation System (PNS) provides continuous updating of position, velocity, and attitude information of a vehicle without recourse to radiating or external navigation aids. The system accurately computes navigation information with the utilization of gravity sensors, gravimetric maps, vertical position, and velocity measurements. Sensor and map data are optimally processed by real time filtering to compute the best position, velocity, and attitude of the vehicle. The products of measured gravity gradients and the velocity of the vehicle are integrated over time to obtain a north, east, down gravity vector components which are combined with corresponding components obtained from a vertical deflection map in a complementary filter. North and east components of the combination are compared with the corresponding components from the vertical deflection map, while the down component of the gravity is compared to the down value obtained from a gravimeter. Residuals from these comparisons are utilized in a Kalman filter to provide corrections that render inertial measuring units in the system independent of the vertical deflections and gravity anomalies. Measured gravity gradients are compared to reference map gradients, the residuals being utilized in the kalman filter to estimate long term position errors and to provide correction for gradiometer bias and drift. A vertical position loop mixes gravity down data obtained from a gravimeter and gravity down data obtained from the integrator to provide vertical position which is compared to a reference derived from the difference between a measured vehicle height and terrain height obtained from a geoidal map. The residual of this comparison is utilized in the Kalman filter to improve estimates of east velocity.","Classifications

The adaptive processor array comprises a plurality of identical processing cells arranged in parallel columns and rows to form a two dimensional matrix. Each of the cells in the array include logic and a memory for storing an internal state. The first row of cells in the array form a parallel input to the array and the last row of cells in the array form a parallel output from the array. The cells in the intermediate rows of the array between the first and last row of the array, except for end cells, are individually coupled to two cells in a previous cell row that are positioned diagonally relative to each such row cell and are also individually coupled to two cells in a subsequent row of the array that are positioned diagonally relative to each such row cell. Logic in each cell computes a new output based upon the two inputs received from the diagonal cells in the previous row, which output, based upon whether cell is programmed to follow a rule of attraction or a rule of dissociation, is utilized to move the internal integer value of the cell toward one of two stages, one state being a state of dissimilarity and the other state being a state of similarity. The state of dissimilarity is also referred to as a state of dissociation, separation or expansion.","Classifications

Interactive object selection pointer method and apparatus,US5808601A,"
An analog to a gravitation force field is generated mathematically to operate between the displayed image of the mouse selection pointer on the screen of a computer display as it interacts with defined selectable objects on the screen. Unlike true gravity, however, the force may be mathematically defined as positive or negative and, thus, permits both attractive and repulsive effects to be imposed upon the movement of the mouse selection pointer displayed on the screen. The paradigm of interaction between the mouse selection pointer displayed on the screen and objects which are selectable thereon is changed to include effects of ""mass"" as represented by an effective field of force operating between the mouse selection pointer display and various selectable items on the screen. Mathematical calculation for the effective radius, or boundary, at which the force calculated to exist between a mouse selection pointer with an assigned mathematical value for mass and an object having an assigned mathematical value for mass may be easily implemented. When the displayed mouse selection pointer position on the screen comes within the force boundary of an object at which the calculated force is at least equal to the mass assigned to the mouse selection pointer attraction instantaneous capture of the mouse selection pointer to the object whose force boundary has been crossed can be achieved. Similarly, though inverse, repulsion between the mouse selection pointer and objects which are deemed unselectable by a computer application running in a computer system may also be implemented.","Classifications

"Rotation, acceleration, and gravity sensors using quantum-mechanical matter-wave interferometry with neutral atoms and molecules",US4874942A,"
The invention is a neutral atom (and/or molecule) matter-wave interferometer (and/or set of interferometers) that can be used as an inertial sensor with a sensitivity exceeding that of conventional mechanical sensors and multiple circuit optical interferometers (including ring lasers) by many powers of ten. An interferometer in which matter-wave propagation beam paths enclose a finite area will sense rotations via the Sagnac effect. One with the paths displaced from each other will sense acceleration plus gravity. The matter-wave energy and mass dependence of the phase shifts that are due to rotation and acceleration are different. Thus a pair of interferometers with different energies and/or masses can perform simultaneous independent measurements of rotation and acceleration. Interferometers with paths that follow a figure-eight pattern yield a gravitational gradiometer. Laser cooling and slowing of a beam of neutral atoms provides a low energy nearly monochromatic source. One form of the invention comprises a sequence of slits and/or diffraction gratings operation in high order. Gratings consist of slits in a solid material or near-resonant standing-wave laser beams. Path curvature due to acceleration and rotation is canceled by magnetic and/or electric field gradients that produce an effective levitation of slow atoms. A feedback system that maintains an interferometer phase null is employed with its error signal yielding the inertial effect signals. Magnetic fields are used for producing matter-wave phase shifts. One form of detector images the Moire pattern formed in the light emitted from the resonance fluorescence of a standing matter-wave fringe pattern and a standing-wave laser beam.","Classifications

Other images, such as signatures and fingerprints, can be treated in a similar manner using either a video camera or a CCD (charge-coupled device). After processing, the video information is displayed on the screen where it is combined with variable data typed in from a keyboard. The digital data from the terminal is fed into a laser printer that prints the portrait and any desired alphanumeric information on a paper sheet. The paper is then laminated, under heat and pressure, between two sheets of transparent thermoplastic material, at a temperature and pressure sufficient to cause the plastic material to penetrate the interstices between the fibers of the paper card and form a unitary structure that cannot be deliminated without destruction of the identifying data. The digital information is stored in a permanent memory to allow the card to be reproduced later, with or without modifications.","Classifications

Method and system for rating patents and other intangible assets,US9177349B2,"
A statistical patent rating method and system is provided for independently assessing the relative breadth (“B”), defensibility (“D”) and commercial relevance (“R”) of individual patent assets and other intangible intellectual property assets. The invention provides new and valuable information that can be used by patent valuation experts, investment advisors, economists and others to help guide future patent investment decisions, licensing programs, patent appraisals, tax valuations, transfer pricing, economic forecasting and planning, and even mediation and/or settlement of patent litigation lawsuits. In one embodiment the invention provides a statistically-based patent rating method and system whereby relative ratings or rankings are generated using a database of patent information by identifying and comparing various characteristics of each individual patent to a statistically determined distribution of the same characteristics within a given patent population. For example, a first population of patents having a known relatively high intrinsic value or quality (e.g. successfully litigated patents) is compared to a second population of patents having a known relatively low intrinsic value or quality (e.g. unsuccessfully litigated patents). Based on a statistical comparison of the two populations, certain characteristics are identified as being more prevalent or more pronounced in one population group or the other to a statistically significant degree. Multiple such statistical comparisons are used to construct and optimize a computer model or computer algorithm that can then be used to predict and/or provide statistically-accurate probabilities of a desired value or quality being present or a future event occurring, given the identified characteristics of an individual patent or group of patents.","Classifications

Concatenated expected responses for speech recognition using expected response boundaries to determine corresponding hypothesis boundaries,US9984685B2,"
A speech recognition system used for hands-free data entry receives and analyzes speech input to recognize and accept a user's response. Under certain conditions, a user's response might be expected. In these situations, the expected response may modify the behavior of the speech recognition system to improve performance. For example, if the hypothesis of a user's response matches the expected response then there is a high probability that the user's response was recognized correctly. This information may be used to make adjustments. An expected response may include expected response parts, each part containing expected words. By considering an expected response as the concatenation of expected response parts, each part may be considered independently for the purposes of adjusting an acceptance algorithm, adjusting a model, or recording an apparent error. In this way, the speech recognition system may make modifications based on a wide range of user responses.","Classifications

Additives for lubricating oils, hydrocarbon oils and power transmitting fluids are oil-soluble esters of hydrocarbon substituted succinic acid, the hydrocarbon being saturated and being a polymer containing at least 50 aliphatic carbon atoms. Examples of the ester are the dimethyl ester of polyisobutene succinic anhydride, the polyisobutene succinic anhydride which has been esterified with polyethylene glycol and further reacted with barium oxide to produce a mixed ester-metal salt and the polyisobutene succinic anhydride which has been esterified with a styrene-allyl alcohol copolymer and then reacted with propylene oxide. Examples are given of the addition of these esters to SAE mineral lubricating oils which may also include the usual additives especially the metal phosphor dithioates and their epoxide adducts.ALSO:The invention comprises an oil-soluble ester of a hydrocarbon-substituted succinic acid, the hydrocarbon being saturated and being a polymer containing at least 50 aliphatic carbon atoms. The ester may be prepared by reacting an alcohol or phenol with a hydrocarbon-substituted succinic anhydride or acid, preferably at 150 DEG to 300 DEG C. and in the presence of an esterification catalyst, by reacting an epoxide or a mixture of an epoxide and water with a hydrocarbon substituted succinic anhydride or acid or acid halide, by reacting maleic acid or anhydride with an alcohol and reacting the obtained mono- or di-ester of maleic acid with the polyolefin, and, finally by esterifying itaconic anhydride or acid and then reacting with the polyolefin. The preferred method is by reacting a polyhydric alcohol having 2-10 OH radicals with 0.5-10 moles of hydrocarbon-substituted succinic anhydride, the hydrocarbon being a polymer of a C2- 6 mono-olefin having a M.Wt. of 700-5000. The examples relate to the treatment of polyisobutene succinic anhydride and of the succinic anhydride of the copolymer of 90 isobutene and 10 piperylene.

A set of note, or tone, generators with availability assignment control means for capturing a pulse in the multiplexed signal are each rendered responsive to a given captured pulse for generating the tone represented by that pulse. The appropriate tone is generated digitally in the form of amplitude samples of a waveform stored in a memory, and the amplitude samples are subsequently subjected to digital-to-analog conversion for ultimate production of the audible output of the organ. Attack and decay of the tone, or note, waveform envelope are simulated by appropriately scaling the amplitude samples at the leading and trailing portions of the waveform envelope.","Classifications

Protuberances may have almost any shape but as disclosed they are in the form of hooks, whereby the product is useful as the hook part of a flexible hook and loop fastening element such as the well known ''''Velcro'''' fastener. The base of the web is either a porous woven or nonwoven fabric or an extruded film, the fabric being impregnated with or the film being formed from molten plastic simultaneously with molding of the hooks. Dies for forming the hooks are separate continuous loops of wire having a cross-sectional contour and hook-molding recesses such that the wires form hooks in rows extending lengthwise of the base sheet. The width of the final product is established by the number and spacing of the wire dies. The wires are passed through lips of an extruder having openings conforming snugly to the cross-sectional contour of each wire. The openings strip the plastic material from the surfaces of the wires, leaving hook-shaped deposits of plastic in the molding recesses of the wires which are attached to the base sheet and, when cool are stripped from the wires.","Classifications

The interconnecting joints between a semiconductor chip and a substrate are non-uniform in shape. The joints are solder and have varying shapes due to varying sizes of the solder wettable regions on the substrate. Smaller solder wettable regions cause the solder connectors to increase chip substrate standoff thereby relieving the stress on the remaining joints.","Classifications

Analog computation of insurance and investment quantities,US3634669A,"
A portable analog computer for determining insurance requirements, taking net worth into account, and for calculating investment returns on funds that are incremented periodically and earn compound interest at a prescribed rate. The computer includes assemblages that are oppositely energized from a common power supply and are connectable to a single indicating instrument. The latter is switchable to indicate direct computations and the difference between certain computations. Consequently, the computer can indicate the total funds required for specified family needs, the total net worth of the family and the difference between the two, which can be provided by insurance. Among the funds required for specified family needs are those used in making guaranteed monthly payments over a prescribed number of years and those used in meeting lump sum obligations. Each constituent of these funds is calculated using a potentiometer arrangement in which a constant voltage from the power supply is converted into an output current that is proportional to the amount in question. The output currents are variously combined and read by an ammeter indicating instrument. In the case of the monthly income fund, a resistive element is included between the source of constant voltage and the associated potentiometer arrangement in order to discount the indicated result in accordance with the interest rate paid on funds that are held to make monthly payments. Also included in the computer is a potentiometer arrangement for making the desired compound interest calculations, in which the amount being compounded is incremented periodically. This arrangement is loaded by a resistive network that is set in accordance with the particular interest rate.","Classifications

Coupling arrangement and tools for same,US3584667A,"
A torque-transmitting or coupling arrangement and tools for same consists of a body portion having a first series of similar arcuately curved surfaces with their centers of curvature located at the corners of a regular hexagon and which surfaces are disposed outwardly of such centers with respect to the axis of the body. A second series of surfaces curved oppositely to those of the first series and alternating therewith extend substantially to the sides of said hexagon midway between the corners thereof while the ends of the second series merge tangentially with adjacent ends of the first series. The radius of curvature of the second series is from two to three times that of the first series whereby the midpoint of said second series is closer to the axis of said body than the midpoint of said first series by an amount equal approximately to 50 percent more than the length of the radii of said first series. Moreover, each of the first series of surfaces has an angular extent of the order of 20 to 25* whereby the resultant shear area provided outwardly of the second series of surfaces is approximately double the shear area formed inwardly of the first series of surfaces. Also, contiguous surface portions of said two series of surfaces are formed defining a driving area of 10 to 20* whereby higher torques than heretofore possible can readily be transmitted from a driving unit to a driven unit of mating configuration without damaging either.","Classifications

Nontoxic radiopaque multiwall medical-surgical tubings,US3618614A,"
Multiwall surgical tubing, especially for stomach, thoracic or rectal use, has an inner, relatively thick transparent tube encased in a relatively thin, visually transparent, outer shell which contains a radiopaque material, so that as the X-radiation passes through the lateral edges of the composite tube it must pass through a relatively long path at the side edges of the tubing, while the central portion remains substantially transparent. Thus, the position of the tube is readily observed by fluoroscopy, while the flow of contrast media or clots may be observed in the central portion. As used for a heart, ureteral or vein intubation catheter, the multiwall tubing is formed of extruded polyethylene containing a nontoxic, radiopaqueplasticizing compound such as bismuth, oxychloride, which is encased in an extruded outer shell of transparent polyethylene having a hardness and exterior smoothness superior to that of the inner tubing, which outer shell also increases the angular resistance to twisting in use.","Classifications

Method and apparatus for detecting at a distance the status and identity of objects,US3665449A,"
A non-contact method of and system for distinguishing the presence, identity or status of an object. The system comprises a marker including a ferro-magnetic material to accompany each object to be detected, means for producing an alternating magnetic field within a zone through which the objects are to pass, means for monitoring magnetic flux changes within the zone and a circuit for detecting a flux change within the zone which corresponds to a signal characteristically produced by magnetization reversal of the marker ferro-magnetic material. The marker includes a relatively long, relatively thin, open-strip of a ferro-magnetic material and may include a remanently magnetizable control element to provide a sensitized and desensitized marker for demagnetized and magnetized states, respectively, of the control element. A plurality of magnetic field producing means are employed to produce in the zone magnetic fields of different orientations, virtually assuring production of a characteristic signal when a marker is passed into the zone.","Classifications

Apparatus and method for exhaust analysis,US3593023A,"
An apparatus and method for determining the content of certain constituents in hot gases, such as the exhaust of motor vehicles or the like. The exhaust gas is conveyed by a pump to an air cooled condenser to lower the temperature of the gas to essentially ambient temperature and thus condense water vapor therein. The gas is then heated to a temperature above said ambient temperature while being conveyed from the condenser through a conduit to a sample cell of a radiant energy analyzer so that water vapor in the gas passing through the conduit and cell will not condense upon the walls thereof. The cell is positioned above a water trap in the condenser a distance sufficiently great so that no water in the trap will be carried into the cell by the flow of gas passing through the apparatus. The gas is preferably conveyed through the apparatus by means of a jet pump connected to an outlet port on the cell. The jet pump embodies a restriction at its outer end to provide automatic pressure regulation in the apparatus so that the gas pressure in the sample cell will remain relatively constant regardless of pressure fluctuations in the air supply that drives the pump.","Classifications

Apparatus for molding plastic shapes in molding recesses formed in a moving endless belt,US3594863A,"
Apparatus for continuously forming extruded strips of plastic material with molded pilelike protuberances integral therewith. Protuberances may have almost any desired shape but as disclosed are in the form of hooks and loops which may be used as the hook and loop parts of flexible fasteners such as the well-known ''''Velcro'''' fasteners. For the latter use the strips and molded protuberances made on this apparatus are secured to a base web of flexible sheet material to produce a final product in which there are closely spaced rows of pilelike hooks and/or loops. The means for forming the strips and protuberances include continuous parallel grooves formed in an endless belt which is moved lengthwise through an extruder nozzle having entrance and exit lips pressed against the belt. The lips are shaped to correspond with the belt and to fit into the grooves and over the ridges between the groves in such manner that molten plastic material will be extruded in form of strips. Protuberances are formed in shallow elongated cavities formed in walls of grooves or ridges in belt. Exit lip will scrape all molten material from the belt other than in the cavities or on surfaces where extruded strips lie. A major advantage of the disclosed structure is that protuberances of very thin elongated form are molded without need for high injection pressures since the plastic material is laid in shallow elongated open troughs rather than being forced to enter deeply sunk elongated holes of small cross section. The lips of the extruder nozzle are formed of nonporous foam metal with contours fitting as desired into the grooves of the belt, the formation of such contours being effected by pressing and crushing the foam metal against the belt at a pressure considerably exceeding the pressure thereafter exerted between lips and belt under service conditions.","Classifications

Automotive multiplex system,US3651454A,"
A multiplex system for controlling and sensing various component parts such as head lights, engine temperature, fuel level, and turn signal lights is disclosed. The system employs a single twowire cable to communicate both power and signals between such components and a central control and metering console which may be the instrument dash console. Time multiplex is employed using a reverse polarity for clock pulses from that of the information pulses. Both analog and digital data may be accommodated by using pulse-width modulation as well as bi-level modulation. Receiving units employ a N delay one-shot triggered by the clock pulse and an AND circuit driven by the output of the N delay one-shot and the signal present on the single signal wire, to drive a one-shot which controls a switching device. Similar circuitry is employed for the digital transmitting and the analog transmitter and receiver. A socket input unit for tapping into the single cable in parallel to other input units by employing a piercing plug is disclosed.","Classifications

Apparatus and method in a multiple operand stream computing system for identifying the specification of multitasks situations and controlling the execution thereof,US3614745A,"
A system is described, useful in a multiple operand stream, or parallel, data processing system, for detecting the specification of independent tasks which can be operated upon in parallel. The specification of the independent parallel operable tasks is given by a fork instruction specifying the number of tasks and the physical or logical function to be performed for the task. A fork point can therefore be visualized as a logical node point where a given class of physical or logical tasks is undertaken. There is control apparatus associated with each node point. The control apparatus is a resource distributor-manager and also a controller into which each system resource reports when it has become free from whatever other task it was performing. The control apparatus dynamically allocates resources to the tasks in the fork on an as-available basis. The fork ends at a join point where data from the parallel tasks is coordinated. In one embodiment, the processor which initiated the fork may reach the join point, and apparatus is provided which gives this processor the options to wait for all tasks to be completed and coordinate data itself; to become one of the fork processors and help out by taking on an undistributed task, if one or more tasks remain undistributed; or to abort, for example under priority interrupt, and go to another job leaving the data to be coordinated by another processor in the system. The control apparatus includes subsystems, each comprising first and second queueing means, the first queueing means for queueing fork instructions as they are issued, and second queueing means for allowing the control of a plurality of fork instructions at a given time.","Classifications

Drag reducer for land vehicles,US3697120A,"
A drag reducer for a gap in a land vehicle moving through air capable of stabilizing the stagnant air in the gap which tends to rotate and form a horseshoe shaped vortex. The vortex directs the surrounding airstream around the stable vortex and thereby reduces air resistance. The drag reducer is a substantially Vshaped plate having concave sides vertically mounted midway in the gap existing between a tractor and trailer on the forward panel of the trailer. The plate stabilizes the rotating vortices and, particularly, prevents side winds from forcing the vortices out of the gap, thereby reducing operating costs by eliminating the expensive process of continuously converting high speed air to stagnant air. The drag reducer can be used on all land vehicles and is readily adaptable for use on railroad box cards, trailers in tandem, single chassis trucks, and vehicles towed by car. The drag reducer can take the form of two plates mounted in parallel on one wall or can be mounted on opposite walls substantially in the same plane. The drag reducer not only reduces operating costs, but also improves the stability of the trailing vehicles and increases car safety. The drag reducer can also take the form of an opened ended conduit that has one end located at the base of the rotating vortex and the other end either in the slip stream or connected to vacuum apparatus so that stagnant air can be sucked out of the middle of the vortex and thereby stabilize the vortex.","Classifications

A METHOD FOR CONTROLLING, BY A NOVEL FEEDFORWARD-FEEDBACK ADAPTIVE SYSTEM, A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF TREATING A FLUID, CONTAINING AN INGRIEDENT, THAT INCLUDES INCORPORATING A DOSAGE OF ADDITIVE IN THE FLOWING FLUID SO AS TO CHANGE THE INGRIDIENT. DURING THE OPERATION OF THE PROCESS, WITHOUT THE USE OF THE CONTROL METHOD, THERE CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE VARIATIONS AFFECTING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE TREATMENT SO AS TO REQUIRE CORRECTION OF THE DOSAGE OF ADDITIVE TO AN UNPREDICTABLE EXTENT. A DEVICE FOR THIS SYTEM PROVIDES FOR AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF DOSAGE OF THE ADDITIVE. IN THE PROCESS THERE IS A NONLINER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIVE AND THE DEGREE OF TREATMENT. THIS RELATIONSHIP CAN BE EXPRESSED AS A MONOTONIC CURVE WITHIN THE RANGE OF CONCENTRATION OF THE INGREDIENT IN THE FLUID AND THE RANGE OF DOSAGE REQUIRED FOR THE DESIRED EXTENT OF TREATMENT. THE CONTROL METHOD COMPRISES: A FEEDFORWARD CONTROL PROCESS INCLUDING (1) MONITORING THE FLOWING FLUID TO SENSE A PROPERTY OF THE FLUID RELEVANT TO THE TREATMENT OF THE FLUID BY THE ADDITIVE, AND (2) GENERATING A FIRST SIGNAL PROPORTIONAL TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SENSED PROPERTY OF THE FLUID TO BE TREATED, A FEEDBACK CONTROL PROCESS INCLUDING (1) MONITORING A PRODUCT OF THE TREATMENT PROCESS TO SENSE A PROPERTY OF THAT PRODUCT RELEVANT TO THE DESIRED RESULT OF THE TREATMENT PROCESS, (2) GENERATING A SECOND SIGNAL PROPORTIONAL TO THE DESIRED MAGNITUDE OF THE SENSED PROPERTY OF THE PRODUCT, (3) GENERATING A THIRD SIGNAL PROPORTIONAL TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ACTUAL SENSED PROPERTY OF THE PRODUCT, AND (4) COMPARING THE SECOND AND THIRD SIGNALS TO PROVIDE AN ERROR SIGNAL INDICATING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND DESIRED SENSED PROPERTY OF THE PRODUCT, AN ADAPTIVE CONTROL PROCESS INCLUDING (1) SUPERIMPOSING THE FIRST SIGNAL ON THE ERROR SIGNAL BY DIVIDING THE LATTER BY THE FORMER TO PROVIDE A FOURTH SIGNAL, (2) INTEGRATING THE FOURTH SIGNAL OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO PROVIDE A FIFTH SIGNAL, AND (3) MULTIPLYING THE FIRST SIGNAL BY THE FIFTH SIGNAL TO OBTAIN A SIXTH SIGNAL THAT INCLUDES THE VARIABLE GAIN FOR THE FIRST SIGNAL BY THE EXTENT OF THE FIFTH SIGNAL, AND USING THE SIXTH SIGNAL TO ADJUST THE DOSAGE OF ADDITIVE INTO THE FLUID.

"Multiple frequency ultrasonic method and apparatus for improved cavitation, emulsification and mixing",US3614069A,"
Method and apparatus for obtaining a state of cavitation, emulsification and mixing wherein materials are subjected to a band of ultrasonic frequencies which are gradually shifted downwardly to cause bubbles in the material to grow and then applying a second set of ultrasonic frequencies but of a much lower frequency and of a higher intensity than the first ultrasonic frequencies for causing the bubbles to expand to a size such that catastrophic collapse takes place. The lowfrequency ultrasound is also varied in frequency so as to cause the bubbles to collapse and implode. In this case, the lower frequency is caused to increase in frequency by periodically sweeping the lower frequency upward. The method and apparatus provide improved cavitation, emulsification and mixing of substances as, for example, water-in-oil.","Classifications

Self-adaptive system for the reproduction of color,US3612753A,"
A method and apparatus for the production of color pictures, especially of the ''''half-tone'''' variety wherein the color fidelity of the reproduction matches that of the original picture or transparency from which the reproduction is produced. Initial printing plates are produced for printing a color standard which contains every one of a large plurality of arbitrary color patches. The same ink, paper, printing plates and printing process are used to prepare the matrix as will be used in the final production process. The printed matrix is then point-bypoint scanned for correlating the original color data with the colors of the printed result so as to fully take account of the characteristics of the ink, paper, plates and printing process. The modified color information is then utilized in the reproduction process during which the picture to be reproduced is scanned point-by-point to determine its tristimulus values (red, green and blue). The color data previously developed operates on the tristimulus values and the color information to determine what excitation is needed for each tristimulus value to sensitize the corresponding points on each of the color printing plates to be used in the reproduction process.","Classifications
